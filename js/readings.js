	readingtitle: 'Jump the Hurdles',
	readingbody: 'Life must be a challenge. Only then is it exciting. In an obstacle race, you are forced to surmount all the obstacles: to jump over the hurdles, go through barrels, crawl under rugs, climb over walls. What would happen if, to avoid all that, you went around all the obstacles and asked for the winner’s cup? Would they give it to you? No. They would say, “You must go back and face all the obstacles.” Why? you might ask. “If you are interested in giving me the cup, just give it.” Sorry. You have to prove that you deserve it, that you worked for it. Life is also a game, and we are proving ourselves. The challenge itself is joyous. If your life is always smooth, when you have great grandchildren you won’t be able to sit back and tell them about all the adventures you had. Imagine this conversation: “You know, my child, when I was young like you this is what I did…” “Oh! Grandpa, you did that? And then what happened?” “I went to the jungle. I was chased by a tiger.” “Ah! Ooo! Is that so?” It will be so enjoyable to tell stories like that. Instead if you just say, “Well, since my birth I just sat there at home. Nothing much happened,” the kids will get up and walk away. They won’t even listen to your story. So have something exciting to tell everyone later on. You will be so happy and proud. Make your life as exciting as possible, but always think of it as fun. The adversities as well as the harmony should be enjoyable. Don’t become sober and morose and have a castor oil face in the name of spirituality. Just be happy. Jump with joy. Even if you make a mistake, say, “Hey, I did this? Great! What a wonderful lesson I learned!” If you really want to, you can make everything fun.'

	readingtitle: 'The World Will Be a Fantastic Place',
	readingbody: 'There is a simple proverb told in the countryside of South India. If two good people coming from opposite directions are walking on the same narrow footpath, there will be three roads. If there is one good person, there will be two roads. If both are bad people, there will be only one road. Probably this needs a little explanation. If both of the people are good, both will give room for the other one to walk on the path. That means they will create two more paths, emptying the centre one. There will be three paths and they will comfortably pass, smiling at each other. If there is one good person and one bad person, the good person will move out of the way and give room on the path for the bad person. So there will be two paths. When both are bad people, they will come and push each other. “Hey, you! Get out!” “No, no, no! You get out!” There will be only one path. The moral of the story is this: If you want peace, forget yourself. Think of the benefit of the other person first. “How can I serve you? How can I make you comfortable?” That’s the way it should be. Giving brings harmony. Love and give, love and give. Think of the other person first. With this kind of attitude, the whole world will be a fantastic place.'

	readingtitle: 'Surrender and Free Will',
	readingbody: 'God wants proof that you are totally surrendering yourself. Tests will come. If you fail the tests then your surrender is not complete. If your surrender is complete, no matter what test comes you will pass it. Once you pass the tests, you don’t have to worry about anything that happens in your life, because you are not responsible for your actions. Whatever comes, comes from God. Whatever goes is taken away by God. It’s not that easy in the beginning because your ego will not allow you to surrender this way. Until you become the master of the ego and give yourself into the hands of God, the ego will even create doubts in you. You might ask, “Then what is free will?” Free will means you are free to take responsibility into your own hands or to give it into the hands of God. If you take the responsibility yourself, after going through all these problems, difficulties and turmoil, you will finally say, “I am tired, God. I’m not going to try to handle this anymore. I know I cannot. So the best thing is for me to put the reins in Your hands. Let me take the back seat. You drive.” There comes a time like that. That’s when your ego has been completely cleaned. Then, even though it might appear to others that you are doing something, you will know that you are not doing it. You are being made to do it. It is very difficult to have that kind of total surrender to God because the ego enjoys its supremacy. It won’t give up that easily; there will be a big fight. You have to prove your capacity.'

	readingtitle: 'Real Love is Possible',
	readingbody: 'Don’t love only your fellow humans. Love everyone and everything equally. All things are your fellow beings, not only humans. By loving everything, you are really loving yourself. Everything is nothing but the expression of yourself. If you stand in front of a mirror, you love that reflection. You smile at it and it smiles at you. In the same way, the whole world is your projection. You love because you are made of love; not because you have to love. The scriptures say to love your neighbor as your Self. You don’t love your neighbor as an individual; you love that person as your Self. That means you have to see your Self in the other person. Real love is possible only when you see everything as your own expression. All others are none other than you; they just appear to be different. We always need to go beyond the name and form. When we rise above the worldly limitations, we will find that the essence is the same.'

	readingbody: 'As long as you are in the world playing a part in this big drama, use the makeup and costumes, but don’t get caught in your part. Have fun and play that part until the curtain falls. Many people finish their part even in the midst of the drama. Once their part is over, they make their exit. Then they don’t come back to the stage again. On the world’s stage, many of us finish our job and leave, but the drama continues. Maybe the hero, the heroine, and the villain will continue throughout, and be the last people to leave the stage. In the meantime, many extras come and go. We are probably all extras. Remembering this will help to keep the ego a little bit soft.'

To be humble, to be as quiet and silent as possible, is a sign of great wisdom. Wise people don’t speak much. Just a few words here and there is enough. They don’t need to say more than that. People learn just by seeing them and by sitting in their presence.'

	readingtitle: 'God is Not a Fool',
	readingbody: 'Question: How can we develop service as an instinctive, natural habit in our lives? Sri Gurudev: By knowing that you are always serving. You don’t need to develop anything. Simply know that you are not doing anything other than serving. God sent you, and He must have had a purpose for sending you. He is not a fool. He will use you to fulfill His purpose. When He is not using you, you should not think, “Oh, I am no use at all. I am just sitting and doing nothing.” That means that you forgot who is in charge. Your attitude should be, “Maybe God is just not using me now.” We are all tools in the hands of God. He brought us here to be used and He is literally using every one of us. It is God’s energy that is in us. God is using me to say these things, and God is using you to listen. In a way, God is speaking and God is listening. It’s not that I am in any way a great master, literate and enlightened, and you are all fools. No. It is simply that on this dramatic stage God is having me sit here and say something, and He is having you sit there listening. I know that it’s God making me sit here and making you sit there. If you don’t know it, that is the problem.'

	readingbody: 'Saint Ramalingam once said, “When I repeat God’s name, it is not only my tongue that repeats it; my whole body, my bones, my flesh repeat it. I feel that everything is melting.” Imagine that your beloved friend or partner went away somewhere and after five years he or she is returning. You are waiting at the airport and watching the customs gate as the passengers come in. The minute you even catch a glimpse of your loved one, how your heart pounds. Have you ever experienced that? You should experience at least that much when you think of God. If that happens on the ordinary, physical level, imagine how much greater it is at the higher levels. So you should develop that. You can develop that. That is the purpose behind constant repetition of the mantram, constant remembrance through prayer.'

	readingtitle: 'Health is Your Birthright',
	readingbody: 'Don’t think that Hatha Yoga is just for athletes or for young people. It is written in the ancient yoga scriptures: “Anyone who practices yoga properly and sincerely becomes a siddha — an accomplished one — be he young or old, weak or strong, or even very elderly or sickly. From prince to peasant, child to grandparent, ailing to robust — all can practice these yoga postures and get maximum benefit.” Health is your birthright, not disease; strength your heritage, not weakness; courage, not fear; bliss, not sorrow; peace, not restlessness; knowledge, not ignorance. The person with health and strength of body, soundness of mind, with morality and spirit is a real gem among all humanity. Such a one possesses the true treasure.'

	readingtitle: 'Try This Yourself',
	readingbody: 'The aim behind all the hatha yoga postures is to be able to sit in one steady, comfortable position for meditation. It is only in a steady posture that you can have a good meditation. A body filled with toxins, weak muscles, and jumpy nerves will not be able to stay quiet for any length of time. But the hatha yoga postures eliminate the toxins and give strength and steadiness. When the body is healthy and supple, you can easily sit with the mind still and peaceful. As you begin to control the body and its movements, that control will carry over to the mind. Try this yourself. Any time the mind is agitated, just sit quietly, not moving at all. Let the mind be as agitated as it wants. If your body is still, very soon the mind will calm down all by itself. Why? Because when there is no physical movement, the breath becomes slow; and the breath is the interconnection between mind and body. As the breath slows, the thought-making process slows down and the mind becomes calm. The asanas or postures help to train the mind. Without purity of body, it is very difficult to purify the mind. Learn to live a natural life. First be physically at ease, and mental peace will follow. Live in a way that makes your body light, healthy, and more supple. Then when you sit for meditation, you won’t feel aches and pains and spend your time meditating on them.'

	readingtitle: 'It is Something Super',
	readingbody: 'You should have a close personal relationship with God. That’s why sometimes it’s easier to have a personal representation of God than an abstract one. You can communicate better, you can look at the face, you can garland Him, you can feed Him. God is nameless, formless, abstract; you cannot simply go and hug space. That is why most people need a symbol. It can be whatever pleases you. Develop your relationship with that. Marry yourself to that representation of God. Think of it day and night. Treat that as your inseparable partner. Once you develop that kind of relationship you will soon begin to see that God is always there next to you. Even if you forget sometimes, He will remind you, “Honey, I am here. Don’t worry.” Devotion cannot be compared with any other approach. It is something super. When you develop that kind of devotion you rise above all doubts. You feel the presence always with you, and you feel that you are totally protected. Develop that kind of devotion by your constant remembrance of the Divine.'

	readingtitle: 'You Can Influence Your Surroundings',
	readingbody: 'You can build up your strength to the point where you are not influenced by your surroundings; in fact, you can influence the surroundings instead. You can change the environment if you have the strength of mind; but even if your mind isn’t that strong, you can still have the strength not to be affected by the environment. Learning not to be affected is an important step. If you are influenced by a situation, how can you change it? If fifteen people are crying and you go there and join them in the crying, you have simply added one more miserable person; you have not done anything to benefit those people. Instead, if you are really strong and can maintain your own equanimity, all the fifteen people will be benefited by your strength.'

	readingtitle: 'Rest at the Top',
	readingbody: 'Wherever you are, whatever you do, have discipline in your life. Discipline your mind, discipline your senses, discipline your body. When we want a big reward, we have to pay a big price. Nothing comes easily. Even for a few minutes of ego gratification for climbing to the top of a mountain, so much effort is needed. How many months of great difficulties will you have to undergo to attain such a goal? How many times will you slip, get up, start, slip, get up, start again? At last you stand there at the top, plant your flag, and say, “I conquered Everest.” You may have conquered Everest, but you can never rest there. In ten minutes you even have to come down. For that ten minutes’ joy you worked so hard, you followed so many disciplines. Then it’s over. In the spiritual life, however, once you get to the top, you have reached Ever-rest. You do rest there, and you won’t have to come down. You can even pull others up as well. But there are no shortcuts. A great price must be laid to reach that great goal. What is that price? Leading a selfless life.'

	readingtitle: 'We Are All Learning',
	readingbody: 'Let us not deny anybody just because he or she follows a certain path or doesn’t follow a certain path. Ultimately we are all learning. If anyone is interested in knowing what practices you are doing, talk about it; explain how you have benefited, but don’t try to persuade another to do the same thing. That is what is meant by the Biblical saying, “Ask and it shall be given.” You don’t have to go and teach anyone. If someone asks, simply share what you know. If that person wants to do the same thing, fine. If not, if he or she wants to follow another path, that’s fine too. With such an attitude you will learn to love everyone, respect everyone, and there will be harmony in your life.'

If it is your victory alone, you may win the war now, but your enemy will be waiting for another opportunity to fight and be victorious over you. How can you call it a real victory if you still have an enemy somewhere? Instead, make your enemy your friend. That is the best victory. Such a victory is only won by non-violent means, by trusting and by showing love.'

	readingtitle: 'Both Have Lessons to Learn',
	readingbody: 'If you want to give some advice, your first duty is to look and see if that person will accept it, if he or she will be benefited by your saying something. If the person gets upset, it shows that you don’t know how to say it gently in the proper way. In that case, you learn something from it: “Ahh, I made her angry. I should have known how to present the problem. It is her problem, but I have to learn how to present it in the right way. Maybe I put it bluntly and that is why she got upset.” There are things for you to learn also. If your intention is to help someone but you fail to make him realise that you are helping him, it’s your mistake. You can’t blame him for that. The giver of the help should remember certain things about how to give constructive suggestions. Stop and think, “Is this the right moment to discuss this? Am I presenting it in the proper way?” If you positively know that the person is not in a mood to receive it from you, wait until another time or start very gently. Then give that person time to think about it. Maybe at the spur of the moment the ego will come and say, “How dare you tell me that!” But when you go away, he or she will try to apply your advice. Remember there is a giver and a receiver; both have lessons to learn.'

	readingtitle: 'Anything Can Roll Down',
	readingbody: 'If you cannot control your ordinary, earthly, human nature, you are not going to realise the spirit. Control the tongue, control the eye, control the flesh, control the food. Why? Because we are rising above nature so that we will not be controlled by it. It should be under our control. Every discipline in life ultimately gives you strength to transcend the limitations of the senses. A stone easily rolls downhill. Anything can roll down; but to bring something up is a difficult task. We are trying to raise ourselves up. If you throw something up, it comes back down. Why should it come back? Because the natural gravitation pulls it down. In the same way, our minds and bodies are constantly being pulled down toward the earth and we are trying to change that. We want to get the help of a rocket to go past the gravitational pull. That is why we have all the disciplines. Without discipline, this ascent would not be possible at all. Even if one wire is loose or one conductor is weak, a rocket launch is postponed. We are all trying to launch our rockets. The mind is a rocket. The body is the launching pad. Your mind must be well-fuelled and well-tuned, and then you must set fire. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero! Launch yourself. Once you go beyond the gravitational pull, you transcend the mind. Realisation comes only when you have a proper launching pad (body) and proper rocket (mind) to help push you beyond the gravitational pull. At this point, the analogy ends, because you are not really launching yourself from here to somewhere else. Everything happens right where are. Right here you can master the forces that pull you down. You don’t have to shoot off somewhere, but you do have to discipline the mind and body. Only then can you command nature.'

	readingtitle: 'Utilise Your Love',
	readingbody: 'Question: When we feel an extra surge of love from within, what can we do to keep that love flowing instead of being blocked up inside or focused all on one person? Sri Gurudev: When you feel that extra surge of love, you have hundreds of opportunities to share it. If you see a withering plant, immediately go and tend to it, take the weeds out, give it some nourishment and water. If you notice a pebble or a piece of glass on the road, love the person who would get cut by stepping on it and pick it up before anyone is hurt. You can show love to plants, to the road, to people, to animals. Let everything that is in your presence make use of that love. Be nice to all. Do something beautiful. Let your love be a universal love. That is true love. Always do something good for all others, not just for people. When I say others, I mean even a little plant or a stone. Pour your love onto all those things. Concern about the feelings of others and the happiness of others is real love. It’s unfortunate that love is often limited to something physical. That’s not love at all. Love is concern for others, doing good to everyone and everything. Utilise your love for the benefit of the Creation.'

	readingtitle: 'See the Real Spirit',
	readingbody: 'Everybody has a clean Self, the image of God. Each also is an expression of the same God. You can perceive that divine element pervading everywhere, functioning through every mind and body. When you do that, you’ll always recognise the Self that is common to everything and everybody. That means you go beyond the so-called sinner and saint. An example is a clear bulb and a coloured bulb. If the bulb is coloured, it gives coloured light. But you wouldn’t say the electricity inside is also coloured. The energy that runs through all the bulbs is the same; external variations are caused by the bodies through which energy passes. If it’s a coloured bulb, it sheds coloured light. The same Self functioning through a clean mind shows a saint. If the mind has all lower tendencies, you call the person a sinner. The one who stands supreme is the one who looks beyond the mind-body element and sees the genuine or real spirit behind it all, even in the so-called sinner. The supreme person still loves that other one as the pure spirit.'

	readingtitle: 'It is All You, You, You',
	readingbody: 'The more you think of yourself — “What can I get?” “How much can I gain?” “What should I wear?” “What should I eat?” “What should I do?” “I! I! I!” — the more karma comes to you. We cannot avoid karma already accrued, but we can avoid the new ones by not doing anything for our sake. By always feeling, “Everything is being done through me by God. I am not doing anything for selfish purposes. I am doing everything for the sake of others, for the benefit of humanity in the name of God.” That way all your actions become selfless service, karma yoga. You do not create any new karma that way. You cannot exhaust all the accrued karma in one lifetime. You come only with what you can burn out in this life. When that is over, another group of karmas will come and you will be given another birth. Until all of it is exhausted, you will take on bodies. If you are lucky enough not to create any new karma, one day everything will be exhausted. There is one way that it all can be burnt — all past, present and future karma. That is when you totally put yourself into the hands of God and say, “I am not the doer, I have not done anything. It is all You, You, You. You do whatever You want. It’s not even my past karma. I made a mistake in thinking it was mine. I know it is all Yours. I simply put the label ‘mine’ on it, so I am suffering. Now I realise no action, and no reaction, was ever mine.” That is the ultimate realisation. When you realise this, you rise above all the karma. You feel that you are not doing anything, and that you have never done anything. It’s true. We have never done anything ourselves; we have no capacity to do anything ourselves. It is God who does everything. So don’t ever say, “I did it. That’s mine. I earned it.” Instead say, “God, it is all You. Even the thought is Yours. The energy is yours, functioning through this instrument. Nothing belongs to me. I am Thine, all is Thine, Thy will be done.” If we realise that, and if we live up to it, then no karma will ever bother us. We don’t need to worry about anything.'

	readingbody: 'Nothing will bother you if your relationship with it is correct. Pain becomes evil because you don’t like it. Nothing will bother you, no one will bother you, nothing will harass you if your attitude is right. What is the right attitude? You should understand that no pain will come to you unless you do something to deserve it. Pain is not really that gracious; it will not just come by to visit. No. If we deserve something, whether good or bad, it will come to us. If we don’t deserve it, nobody can hurt us. No pain can come to us. Deserving means we have done something wrong and through that pain we have to purge it out. Pain is a sort of purgation. Even if the whole world comes forward to give you pain, it cannot if you do not deserve it. But unfortunately we don’t accept it that way. We simply say, “Ohh, I am all innocent. This guy just came and hurt me.” It’s wrong thinking. Pain has no interest in coming to you unless you have invited it. Understand the purpose of the suffering, and accept it.'

	readingtitle: 'We Don’t Lose Anything',
	readingbody: 'Don’t think that you can do everything just by your own capacity alone. Know that there is a higher power, a grace, to help you; but you have to sincerely ask for it. Unless you ask, you won’t receive it. Just by asking, you are opening yourself to that power. It’s not that God is waiting for you to ask; God is not miserly. He is already giving, but we do not always receive. The process of asking is itself opening; you cannot even ask without opening. So open your heart. Even if you can’t open your heart to people, open your heart to God; then you will know how to open your heart to people also. Pray sincerely and trust in a higher power, trust in God. Many, many more things are wrought by prayer than the world dreams of. Let us believe in sincere prayer. What we can achieve by ourselves is very little, but what we can achieve with the help of God is very great. We don’t lose anything by giving ourselves to God. As the great saint Manickavasagar said, “I gave myself to You, Lord, and in return You gave Yourself to me. Who is gaining? With me You are not gaining anything. Just a useless thing, incapable of doing even a little. I’ll be a burden to You, one more stomach to feed. But with You I can do many things. If I have You, I have gained everything in the world. So You see, though You call it a fair business deal, You are really losing.”'

You can become an Olympic champion and win all the gold medals. You can win Nobel Prizes. You can even become a statesman, a president, a multi-millionaire. It’s all nothing. Anybody can do that, and people are doing it easily. The real achievement comes in doing what an ordinary person cannot do. It takes an extraordinary person, an extraordinary mind, a superhuman to achieve the highest goal. If you are not willing to make the greatest effort, don’t even think about the greatest goal. Think about some small goal: “All right, I want to get a medal.” Or “I want to become famous.” Or “I want to be rich.” The spiritual goal is the grandest goal, but people expect it to somehow happen overnight without any effort. There are people who have been working birth after birth toward this goal. It may take ten births, one hundred births, or it may happen tomorrow. If you really make up your mind about what you want, that’s a start. It makes things easier. It’s not just a simple thing you are asking for. When somebody wanted to follow Jesus, what did he say? “Get rid of everything, give it to the poor. Take up your cross, and follow me.” What does it mean? Give up everything.

One is, “Let me stick with it. Let me stay put and face the challenge, try to understand it, learn the lesson, and rise above it.” It really takes a lot of strength, a lot of courage, a lot of confidence to do that. It takes total faith in a Higher Will. If you cannot develop that kind of strength, you can just walk out. You are not really making a big mistake by doing that.

If you really cannot do it, if you have struggled for a long time, and if you weren’t strong enough and you failed, it does not matter. Don’t keep fighting against the current. Maybe you are not strong. Swim in a little shallower water. But know that although you are running, you are not escaping. The same kind of challenge will come there also, in a little different form. Why? Because difficulties come to make us strong. It’s true. Life is an obstacle race and a challenge has been presented to you. I would recommend that you first try to face it with all your heart and strength. Find the ways and means to do it. Only if you are really positive that you cannot do anything more, that you really cannot continue — “I’m getting weaker and weaker and weaker, and I have to take a little time to get my strength back” — okay, then take a break. The strength that will enable you to overcome every obstacle is the strength and confidence that comes from total faith in God. When you have that kind of strength, nothing is impossible to achieve. You don’t have to run away from anything.'

	readingbody: 'If you have absolute faith, you will always be happy and joyful even in the midst of suffering. You may have severe handicaps, but you can still be joyful. When Tirunavukkarasar, one of the well-known Saiva saints, was suffering from a stomachache, he said, “Lord, I know You gave me this stomachache. I don’t know what l did to deserve it. Certainly I did something; but I don’t remember what it is. Maybe it was even in a previous birth. But one thing I do know: You want me to trust You completely. Probably this is the only way You can make me do that. You are very kind to make me think of You. If You didn’t love me, why would You even bother to give me this problem? You wouldn’t even be thinking of me. The very fact that You thought of me makes me happy; because this has made me remember to think of You. When I experience pleasure, I may forget You; but when I experience pain, I can never forget You. I’m not asking You to get rid of it right away. Please just give me strength and continue to give me this problem until I completely purge out my karma. I know You are merciful. You want to bring out the beauty, the pure part of me, so You are simply rubbing and scrubbing me. It hurts sometimes, but I know that You would not unnecessarily hurt me. If there were another more simple way, You would certainly have done it that way. Probably my problem is too tough. So go ahead; do what You must. All I request is that You give me the strength and the understanding to accept it.” What a beautiful prayer. With this kind of approach, we can face any problem in life. Nothing will shake us, whether it is physical or mental, caused by people or caused by nature. We just need to have that absolute faith.'

Doubt and faith don’t go together. If you have complete faith, nothing is impossible. Nothing. That kind of faith will not grow in an impure, selfish mind; so learn to be selfless. Trust in God and say, “Whatever I deserve, God will give me. Whatever I don’t deserve, God will take away. Whatever l need, God will keep with me.

That’s not the kind of spiritual experience you need. You may have some nice visions; you may see lights, hear sounds. But what is the benefit to others? Real spiritual experience means moving around with a smiling, loving face. That is spiritual. To see the spirit in others and to love everyone; to rise above these little differences of the lower nature and bring harmony wherever you are. If you can’t live harmoniously with others, what is the use of other spiritual experiences? Ultimately, everyone should love you. Keep that in mind: “I will live the kind of life that will make everybody love me, and I will love them.” If that happens in your life, you will know that you are growing spiritually.'

But God need not be a father. God can be a mother also. God can be a brother, a sister, a friend, a tree. God is everything. God is Spirit, and Spirit is above all these distinctions. To realise God as Spirit is what is called spiritual practice. Unfortunately, even in the spiritual life problems come up about male and female. Arguments about men and women don’t belong in a church or synagogue or ashram. There should be no discrimination against one or the other. When you talk about the physical body, you are talking about flesh, blood, and bone. Spirit is above all these things. If you are going to fight about male and female, don’t call yourself a spiritual person. Spirit has no gender. Still, we love the Spirit or God and want it to manifest in some form or other so that we can express our devotion. If you love the image of a father, let God come as a father to you. If you love the image of a mother, God can manifest as a mother for you. If you adore nature, call God by the name of Nature. God is all of these things and more.'

If you don’t care for any of the traditional forms that have been handed to us over the ages, you can create your own form and God will come to you as that. There is no limit to God’s expression. God need not be put into only a few categories. God is ready to send Itself in any form that will help you to realise that Spirit. God is essentially nameless, formless, omnipresent. If you say, “God is omnipresent,” then it is nonsense to say, “God is only this.” It is easy to say the words: “God is omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient,” but hard to fully understand. If we stop to think of the real meaning of the words, then all this limiting of God doesn’t make any sense. However, our mental capacities are limited. The mind cannot truly understand the unlimited One. It is to give us something to focus on that we limit something that is unlimited. We need that help to go beyond the limitation and realise the One or God. That is the reason for all the forms and names we use in worship. Whatever form or name we may choose, let us all remember the real Truth of the limitless, formless, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent One behind them all.'

	readingbody: 'Let us talk a little about samadhi. In the yogic sense, we are talking about the transcendental state of enlightenment. But in India, normally if you say, “He has attained samadhi,” that means he has died and is buried. That is the normal connotation for that term. In a way, samadhi is like that. You are dead, yet you are alive. My Master Sri Swami Sivanandaji used to sing this song: “When shall I see Thee? When ‘I’ ceases to be.” He was asking this question of the Lord. “Lord, when can I see You? I know that will be when ‘I’ ceases to be.” That means that if the ego or “I” dies, you can truly live. If the egoistic “I” goes away from you, you are free from the ego. You are clean, pure. At that stage you are fit to go to heaven, to experience the highest knowledge or the highest truth. That is what we call samadhi. This is the essence of all spiritual teachings and practices, no matter what the label. One can be a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, a Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, or of any religion. Even if you don’t have any faith at all or don’t believe in any organised religion, it doesn’t matter. That is not the criterion to have this realisation. All you have to accomplish is to see that all selfishness goes away. Where does the “I” dwell? In ego. Where does the ego live? In the mind. The ego is, in a way, the very source of mind. All the expressions of the ego, thinking, feeling, willing, could be put together under one term, “mind.” If the mind gets completely purified, then it’s no longer an obstruction to your experience of the Truth. When it is clean and clear, the mind doesn’t colour the appearance of the pure Self. It becomes a pure reflector of the Self to see its own true nature. That is the essence of spirituality.'

Commit as many mistakes as possible, as soon as possible. You’ll become great!” It’s true. Every failure is a stepping stone. Remember, though, that you can’t use the same stone for each step. Every step should be on a new stone. That means you shouldn’t keep on making the same mistakes. Learn well from each one.

If we realise that, why should we worry about the role we are playing? If He wants you to play that part, play it. No part is big or small. Only by knowing this truth can you become great. It is immaterial where you are or what you are doing. The great saint Thayumanavar said, “Don’t worry about which is better, monastic life or householder life. Both are equally good if only you know one secret. What is that secret? We are all tops. There is one Player. He simply winds the string around and pulls it, and then we spin. Depending on how tightly the rope is wound and how fast He plays, you rotate for a while and then you fall down.” It’s not how you present yourself, what you call yourself, what you do for a job that’s important. The most important thing is: Do you know that you are nothing but a top and that at any moment your swinging could stop? The highest realisation is that. Know that every minute that great Presence is in you, functioning through you, and you are nothing but an instrument.'

Those who have the capacity to do something physical as well should take that opportunity. Mental, physical, material, do something in whatever way you can. That is why all those faculties have been given to you. They are not given just for your own use. Your physical strength, your material wealth, everything is given to you to be used for others. Of course, that doesn’t mean that you should not use it for yourself too; but the major part of it is to be offered to others. That’s the way we should mold our lives.

If others do something to you in return, it’s all right; accept it, but don’t look for it. If you look for it, you are setting up conditions. “Only if you love me in return or if you do this and this and that and that will I love you. Otherwise I will not.” All our problems are caused by this. We lose trust and become miserable when love is conducted like a business. You will not be happy with this kind of love. Don’t worry about the other person. Whether it is between husband and wife or even between two friends, if your relationship is based on some gain from that person, you are never going to be happy.

Present them to the mind. Admire them. “Oh, look how terrific this habit is. So useful. Something to be proud of.” Certainly your little baby mind will jump to grab it. As soon as it jumps for the good habit, take away the bad one. If you want to be rid of bad company, what should you do? Just get into good company; the bad company will automatically stay away. It’s simple. You won’t be available to the bad people because you will always be mingling with good people. That’s a very good beginning toward a very high goal. Sri Patanjali calls it pratipaksha bhavanam — substituting positive thoughts for negative ones. Think of the opposite, develop the opposite. If you have hatred, develop love. That is the trick.

It simply means that you have not prayed enough. It’s not just a question of the length of time. You may be praying for ten years and get nothing. Somebody else might pray for one minute and get everything. So the quality of the prayer is the important thing, how honestly, how sincerely you pray. Suppose that even a whole-hearted prayer doesn’t get answered. Then the question is, did you pray with total faith? If you offer a prayer with absolute faith in God, and if the prayer is not answered, will you lose that faith? It is true that all of your sincere prayers will be answered; but that does not mean you will necessarily be given what you want. The answer might be: “It’s no good for you, my child. However much you cry, I can’t give that to you because it will hurt you. Without knowing how to use it, you may hurt others also. It’s dangerous.” If you understand that and accept it, you prove that you trust in God. Don’t just trust in God when you get everything. If, out of one hundred requests, ninety-nine are denied, you should still have that faith. That will eventually lead you to a higher form of prayer where you don’t request anything. You simply say, “Why should I ask You? The fact that I am asking You means that I think You don’t know what I need. How ignorant I am. You know what is good for me; You know what is not good me. Do whatever You want. Why am I even asking for something? Maybe You made me ask. Even the asking seems to be Your prompting. Because You wanted me to ask, I am asking. Still, I leave it to You to give it or not. Maybe You asked me to ask You; then You are going to say no to see whether I will accept it or not.

It’s the wrong direction. I’ll go the other way.” That’s what experience means. Nature itself teaches us, allows us to make mistakes. Didn’t God allow Adam to eat the fruit? Though He said, “Adam, don’t eat the apple,” did He stop Adam when he reached for the apple? He certainly could have stopped him. Instead, He simply allowed Adam to make the mistake so that he would learn the lesson. There should be freedom in learning. Each one learns in a different way. The duty of a teacher is to see if there are any impediments on the path, and clear them so that you can go on. He or she should help you to experience in your own way. By going here and there, and bumping into obstacles, you will very soon understand the truth: “Wherever I go, ultimately I end up with a problem.

	readingbody: 'To enjoy life to the fullest, stop wanting anything. If something comes, let it come. If it goes, let it go. Just be contented with what you have. Even if something goes from what you have, it doesn’t matter. Accept it. You should feel, “God gives me everything that I need, and God takes away everything that I don’t need.” Then you will always enjoy what you have or what you lose. Yes. Enjoy the coming. Enjoy the going. Enjoy the profit, enjoy the loss. The only way to enjoy is to just be what you are. You’re not going to enjoy by getting things. If you are going to enjoy by getting things, you are going to be depressed by losing things. True joy doesn’t come from anywhere. Nothing brings you joy. No person brings you joy. You yourself are joyful always. So enjoy that. That’s what you call enjoyment. Depend on nothing, because nothing from outside can make you joyful.'

	readingbody: 'We are all searching for the happiness and peace that we once experienced. Now it seems to be missing. Certainly we want to find it the quickest way possible. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come that easily. We have to go through many kinds of resistance. Why? Because only by passing through resistance do we become stronger. Resistance is necessary. A seed needs some sort of resistance. That’s why you dig a hole, put the seed in, and cover it up. Then it says, “Oh, you think you are going to stop me here? I’m going to come up!” It pushes through and grows strong. So don’t look for the way of least resistance. No matter how big that resistance is, face the situation. Your own strength, your own mental courage will help you a lot. Once you feel that, “Yes, I can win it!” you will win. Don’t say, “Ah, I don’t know. I’ll try.” No. With that attitude, you have already lost seventy-five percent of your strength. Be bold. Be strong. “I will achieve it. Today or tomorrow I am going to get it.” That’s very important. You need that will to achieve what you really want in life.'

	readingbody: 'We all have a duty toward our children, our parents, our neighbors, our sisters, our brothers, toward everything with which we come into contact. We have a duty toward the land that brings us food, toward the rain that brings us water, toward nature. We are constantly getting things from nature, and we have to return something in some form to that nature, to God. This is what the Hindu scriptures call yagna, or sacrifice. What is sacrifice? To give at least a little more than you get. There are several types of people in the world. One group always gets and never gives anything back; they are called thieves. Another group gets a lot and gives a little; they are debtors. The third group gets one hundred percent and gives back one hundred percent; they are fair businesspeople. Whatever you get, you give back. Then you are not a debtor, you are not a thief; you are a fair business person. There is another group of people. They get something but they give back much more; they are better people. The final group doesn’t get anything; they just give. They give all that they have. They know only giving. They are the best people. So the five categories are: The thief, the debtor, the business person, the better person, and the best or the super person. Out of the five, to which category do you belong?'

He did it to teach that person a lesson. By praying for someone, you open your heart. You become more compassionate; and of course your prayerful thoughts will reach the person being prayed for. If the person deserves to receive them, he will. Even if that happens, don’t think that your prayer literally cured him. Your prayer helped him. Peaceful and healing thought forms spread, and the person who is ready to receive gets healed. That is the power of prayer. Prayers bring powerful thoughts. If the sick person really looks for it and wants it, he or she can use it. You simply make it available. But you cannot force it onto him. If his previous offence was that big, his own destiny might cause him to reject the prayer. Such a person cannot be helped. Don’t think that because you appeal to God, God simply obeys you. That would mean that God doesn’t love that person, and will only help him because you prayed. No. You should remember that each one is God’s child. God doesn’t wait for your prayers in order to take care of His children. Your duty is simply to send the prayers. If the person for whom you’re praying is ready, he or she will receive the prayer. If not, somebody else might get the benefit. That is why we pray for the entire world. Send out the prayers, broadcast. Whoever tunes in, will receive it.'

If you don’t get it, you don’t have it. The realisation doesn’t come little by little. Realisation is instantaneous. When will it happen? Nobody can tell you. Even a small, trifling thing could do it. I will tell you a story about a saint named Patinatar. His father was a very rich man who had made a lot of money from shipping and other businesses. The father had seen many saints and sages and had studied a lot, but nothing had opened his mind to the Truth. He repeated his mantra regularly, performed religious rituals, did all the spiritual practices, but wisdom didn’t dawn on him. One day he asked his son, Patinatar, to take his ship and go buy some merchandise. Patinatar went to an island and saw the poor people there. He spent all the money, millions of dollars, on helping these people. Patinatar realised that he couldn’t go home with an empty ship, so he filled the entire ship with cow dung cakes, which were probably worth a hundred dollars or less. Then he sailed home. As soon as the boat arrived, some of the boatmen ran to the father and told him, “Your son has gone crazy. He spent all of your money, and all he came back with is cow dung.” The father was so upset that he didn’t even want to see his son. When Patinatar arrived at the house, his father was not even there to greet him. Patinatar gave a small package to his mother and said, “Please give this to my father when he comes. I will see you later.” With that, he walked out. When the father came home, he asked, “Where is my son?” His wife told him that Patinatar had come and gone, and gave him the package. When the father opened the package, he found a broken sewing needle and a note. The note said, “Even the eye of a broken needle will not come with you on your final journey.” As soon as he read those words, he immediately took off his fancy clothes, put on a loincloth, said goodbye to his house and his businesses, and walked out. Realisation had dawned in him. He had heard many hundreds of stories before, he had read volumes, he knew all the philosophy, but nothing had opened his eyes until he saw these few words. Realisation can dawn with the smallest thing. It doesn’t have to be a big blow. That trifling thing is what you call the final straw. Wisdom dawns that way. At any moment, anything could be the last straw for you. Then you are enlightened. Until then, you are still preparing yourself. You are getting ready for that moment.'

If you overeat, it’s the Divine Will that makes you overeat. If you fall sick, that’s Divine Will also. You must accept it all as Divine Will. If you feel that something from outside prompts you to do it, that is Divine Will. You need never feel guilty about it. Something may prompt you from within, and your ego may say, “Do it. Go ahead.” If you really feel that everything is Divine Will, even that prompting from your ego comes from the higher source. You may be directed to save a life; that’s Divine Will. Your ego may tell you, “Go and eat a lot of pizza!” If you have the attitude I’m talking about, you will know that this is also Divine Will. Afterward you shouldn’t feel guilty, since it was the Divine Will. Don’t do this halfway. Either feel that it is all Divine Will or it is all your will. If you totally trust the Divine Will, it will not bring conflict. Even if your ego prompts you to do something wrong, God will say, “She is completely trusting Me. Her ego is prompting this, but she is doing it in My name. I should stop it.” God will take care of your ego for you. It is easy to talk about, but very hard to practice. Until you achieve that highest surrender, you can think, “Whatever mistake I do is from my weakness. It’s my ego that makes me do these things.” If everything is nice, “Ah. God must have prompted me to do this. That is why it has come out well.” That way you are always safe.'

Why should you await death? Don’t think that seeing with the eyes is the most important thing. Do you think people who can see well are happy just because of that? In a way, you are fortunate. I tell this even to blind people. How many problems are caused by the things people see? The physical senses can be a tremendous distraction. If you have them, take care of them and use them well. If you don’t have them, don’t worry about it; just forget it. You still have your beautiful mind, your beautiful soul. Many, many people who have limited physical sight, or even no physical sight at all, do great things. You shouldn’t be discouraged. If there is an operation that will help your condition, certainly try it. If there is no possibility of correcting it, it doesn’t matter. Accept it as what God wanted you to have. The minute you learn to accept something, it is no longer that troublesome. You can live with anything and everything. Haven’t you known of people in worse conditions living happily and usefully? The problem is in the mind. If you just accept it, it becomes very easy, very light. If you want to feel bad, you have many hundreds of excuses; but if you want to be happy, you can be happy without any of these things. It’s useless to worry about them. After all, it’s just a body. The so-called limitations should not spoil your joy. Remind yourself: “I’m not the body. I’m not even the mind. I’m the spirit.” Laugh at it and be brave.'

Before you marry, ask yourself, “Can l share my love and my life with someone?

You are gradually dividing yourself, sharing your life with many others. You learn how to take care of them; you have more responsibility, and you are tested constantly. In school you are tested. Why? It helps you to find out whether you learned properly or not. It also helps others to know whether you studied well or not. So, in family life you also have tests to face. If you don’t want to answer the questions and solve the problems there, if you just quit this examination and go somewhere else, eventually you will find an examiner standing in that place too.

You are free to make another kind of mistake, but not the same mistake. Every mistake, every failure is a stepping stone for future success. The problem with so-called perfectionists is that they don’t like to accept failure. You have to fail. Look at an Olympic champion, a great runner. Did he or she run out of the womb at birth? Did he start life running? No. He couldn’t even move his body much. How long did it take for that future champion to be able to stand? To walk? To run? How many times did she fall? That is the process of learning. Don’t be afraid of falling. Let every failure help you to learn a little better for your future success. If you keep that in mind, then you won’t get caught in what is called perfectionism. Everybody learns in this way. In fact, nobody is ever one hundred percent perfect.

	readingbody: 'Ultimately the Higher Will is the final authority. In the case of human beings, free will has been given with certain limitations. You are not free to do everything you want. You can’t fly like a bird. There are many other such limitations. Your will is limited, but within those limitations you are allowed to do certain things freely. Those things are: to be helpful to other beings, to be serviceable to other beings, and to live a harmonious and useful life. You are free to do that. At the same time, you are also free not to live that way. By your own free will, you will face the result of whatever you do. You are even told what is right and what is wrong, but nobody interferes with your free will. It’s been that way since the very first person. According to the Bible, Adam was asked not to eat the fruit. But God had given him free will, and Adam chose to eat the fruit. Did God stop him? No. That is where your free will comes in. You are free even to do wrong things, but you cannot escape from the guilt of having done something like that. That’s why Adam felt guilty. Was it God’s intent to make him feel guilty? No. Through that guilt, God wanted him to learn a lesson. Learning a lesson is more important, so you’re allowed to commit the mistake, feel guilty, and from that learn the lesson. Experience is the best teacher. That’s why free will is given. Those who really want to use free will in the right way would choose by their own free will to give themselves into the hands of the Higher Will. With your free will you say, “Lord, You have given me free will. I know it has limitations. I can only do certain things, and if I try to go beyond those limitations Your will comes and stops me. So what is the idea of having my free will? To have fun? It’s better not to use my free will because ultimately You are the boss. Your Will is the final one, so I give my free will into Your hands. You gave it to me; now please take it back and do whatever You want.” With your own free will, you give yourself into the hands of God. We never lose by giving ourselves into those hands. By giving ourselves completely, we gain more of God. We get all of God if we give our all. Then there is no destiny, and there are no problems.'

A friend in need is a friend indeed. What is your need? To maintain your peace, your health, and happiness. A friend should be a good aid to that. Often we may find it difficult to travel alone. The path is steep. It is always better to have somebody who can help you, who can hold you and see that you don’t slip. We should always look for such friends and, once we find them, we should never lose them. A real friend will not hesitate to point out your mistakes. Those who hesitate are just there to exploit you. You are a comfortable person for them to be around, and they can get something from that. So it is for their own benefit that they are keeping their friendship with you. They are afraid of losing it. A real friend will think of your benefit, not of his or her own. If need be, that friend will be ready even to give up his life for you. In the Thirukkural, Sri Thiruvalluvar describes what friendship is. In South India, where he lived, the men wear dhotis. A dhoti is a long piece of cloth worn tied around the waist. Imagine that you are wearing a dhoti and you are speaking in front of a group of people; as you stand there, all of a sudden your dhoti slips. What would your hands do? Immediately they would catch it. They wouldn’t even wait for a second. That’s what you call friendship: the hands that would help you to hold your dhoti when it falls. A true friend will not hesitate even for an instant. Immediately he or she will jump in and do what is necessary to help. When will you know if a person is really a friend or not? Only when you are facing some difficulty.'

Our measuring instruments, the mind and the vocabulary — are very, very limited. All we can say is, “It’s something blissful.” In that blissful state you always experience joy. You never get disturbed by anything. You never feel any anxiety or worry or fear. In that state of Cosmic Consciousness, there is no fear at all because you see everything as the same: one essence expressed as many. You learn to accept everything as part of the different expressions. In that state there’s no friend, there’s no enemy; it is all the same. We often see images of God with one hand raised, the palm facing outward. That is the hand of fearlessness. The other hand will be pointed down, again with the palm outward. What is He telling us? “If you humble yourself and take refuge at my feet, you have nothing to fear.” Attaining the feet of the Lord means attaining God-Consciousness. When you have that God-Consciousness, you know that everything is God, no matter what it looks like. Then why should we be afraid of anything? The Bhagavad Gita says it beautifully: “Who is a great sage? The one who neither brings fear to anyone, nor is afraid of anyone.” Such a person is a person with that supreme, infinite God-Consciousness.'

If you still need some of them, you can afford to replace them. God knows that also. But most important of all, you still have yourself. Nobody can steal that. This kind of experience is God’s way of making you renounce your attachments. This is the time to check to see how many things you are attached to. Are you suffering because you lost your possessions? Or are you undisturbed, happy, and peaceful? Life is filled with such tests. But only lucky people will get tested in this way. Without this experience, you might have thought that you were a wonderful yogi because there was nothing to disturb you; everything seemed beautiful.

A lot of money is made by gimmicks, by adulterations and things like that. By false advertising. So it’s very hard to have a straight business and compete with those businesses. But if people come to realise that you are running an honest business, certainly they will come to you more. You will never have difficulty in getting enough customers. After some time the truth comes out. Business should be done with service in mind. Think of the benefit of the buyers. Your duty is to give them the right product or service at the right price with a marginal profit for you. You have to continue your business, so your profit can be a little above your overhead expenses to allow for rainy seasons. And business is not always the same.

On a dead and decayed body somewhere. It soars beautifully and high; but it doesn’t cast its eyes on good, holy things, only on decayed matter. An ordinary fly looks for filthy matter to sit on, while a honey bee will fly past many other things to look for even a little bit of nectar on a flower. You see certain things in others because you have the eye to see it. If you have a beautiful eye, you will see only beauty. Know that everyone has some sort of weakness.

It would probably be best for him to do it in front of the rest of the employees, not just the employer. People do make mistakes. Sometimes in a weak moment we lose our strength and do something that’s not right. The minute you realise that you have done something wrong, you should not hesitate to come and say openly, “Yes, I made a mistake. I was weak. I’m sorry for it and I will try my best not to repeat that. Please keep an eye on me and help me.” If you are really interested in changing for the better, you should seek the help of others. This employee should come forward and openly apologise and ask for help. If that is done, I think not only the employer, but the other employees also will feel sympathetic and compassionate toward him and agree to have him continue in that job. If I were the employer, and if I had an employee like that, that’s what I would do. To err is human. Even the employer might have done the same thing at one time or another. We all make mistakes.

Sri Gurudev: Long ago I used to feel lonely until I realised that there is a Lover who is always in me, with me, next to me, closer than my heart. That is God, or the Self: Since then, I have found that I am never alone. If you depend on anything or anybody outside you to be a companion, it is impossible to have that companion always with you. Even if another person wants to be with you always, he or she cannot. We come alone, and we go alone. Don’t depend on outside company. Even as you are coming and going, there is always another there — your own spirit, your own Self, or the God within you. He is in you, outside of you, in front of you, and behind you, to the right, to the left, above, and below. The moment you realise that, you will never feel lonely. Unfortunately we seem to depend on outside things and people for company. The outside company is fine, but don’t depend on it. Be independent of everything. If it comes, fine. If it goes, wonderful. Just because I say, “Don’t depend on that,” you don’t have to reject something if it comes to you. Let it come whenever it wants, and let it go whenever it chooses. Give everything that freedom. The minute you try to cling to something or someone and say, “I want to keep you with me always,” you are creating big trouble. Nobody can be with you always except that God in you. Just because you hear it, it’s not going to happen overnight. You have to contemplate on it. Think of the pros and cons of your depending on other things and other people for your happiness. The more you think about it, the more you will realise, “Yes, I cannot depend on anything. I can’t even depend on the body. I’m keeping it for now, but every day it is little by little getting older. Beauty isn’t permanent. Money isn’t permanent. Friends aren’t permanent. Name isn’t permanent. Fame isn’t permanent.” See if you can name anything that is permanent other than God.'

	readingbody: 'Mantras have great power. Modern science has proven it. With sound vibration, you can make or break. You can heal, or you can produce disease. You can make somebody laugh, you can make somebody cry with your sound. You can turn a human being into an animal who will go out and fight. You can pacify a baby. You can enchant a cobra. You can get more milk from your cow with a little music. Plants grow with nice music. It’s true, and it’s all being proved nowadays. So your mantra repetition is nothing different. Certain mantras can easily cure all your problems, physical and mental. Even repeating, “OM Shanti, OM Shanti, OM Shanti.” Shanti means peace, but it also has that peaceful vibration. It’s very powerful. When you fill your system with that vitality, with that health and happiness, you become contagious. Fill yourself up to the brim with health and let it overflow. Just by your mere presence, you will bring health to others. You can pass it on to others. You will constantly emit that vibration. That will be the beginning of world health. Where should it begin? Right with you.'

	readingtitle: 'Tune to God’s Frequency',
	readingbody: 'The best way to clean your system is to use sound. Simply choose any holy name you like, and keep repeating it. Let your body vibrate with that frequency. In the beginning you have to concentrate on that vibration within you. But as you continue, every cell in your body will begin to repeat your mantram or your prayer; then the whole system, the whole personality, body, mind, everything will vibrate on that wavelength. The holy word is like a radio wave. When a mantram is given to you, you tune your personality to a particular frequency. It’s just like tuning a radio. The cosmic music that comes from God is always being transmitted; God never stops transmitting all the beautiful things. Some simply don’t tune their heart radios to the proper frequency. Instead, they tune it to the wrong frequency and get atmospheric disturbance. With practice, you’ll be able to tune your heart radio. You will become a good receiver. Only then is the proper communication possible. Communication brings communion. Real communion is possible only when you tune your entire personality to God’s frequency.'

	readingtitle: 'A Teepee on Mars',
	readingbody: 'The mind is restless; it is always looking for a change. That is the nature of the mind. It can never be satisfied. It might rebel and want you to go live in a teepee in the mountains. After a while it won’t be happy with your teepee on the mountaintop; it will think that only putting a teepee in the valley will make you happy. Once you are in the valley, it will want a teepee on Mars. There is no limit for the mind’s restlessness. You have to educate the mind. Ask it: “Why do you want to go to the mountain?” “To find peace there.” “Why do you want to come down?” “I am tired of that and want to be with people.” What does it all mean? That you are trying to borrow happiness from outside. Once you realise that peace and joy are always within you, you will be happy no matter where you are. Whether you are in the valley or in the mountains, it is the same thing. Whether you are on the earth or on Mars, it is the same thing. Wherever you are, you should have a purpose. Go to the mountain for a purpose; come down for a purpose. And don’t let that purpose be a selfish one. The purpose should be for the benefit of others, for service to humanity.'

It will immediately elevate you and lift you above the problem.'

If it is the Will of God, everything will go smoothly. If it is your egoistic will, you’ll get the blow right away. God’s Will is always for the benefit of everybody, including you. Your egoistic thought is selfish; it wants your benefit first. The ego always wants something for itself.'

If I could ask You for anything, it would be this: ‘Let me always remember that You are working through me. I am not responsible for any of these things. Please let me not forget this.’” If this is our prayer, our lives will be super, super peaceful. If you have that faith, His power will make you think, make you do. Even the impulse to act comes from Him. When you become a good instrument, the ideas are dropped in. They come and prompt you, “Okay now, go ahead, do this.” Your job is to simply allow it to happen.'

	readingbody: 'Universal love means to see the same Self in everything. Unlimited, unconditional love is universal. If you have universal love, there is not even a single thing you dislike. You love everything, even the mosquitoes that bite you. You don’t dislike them; you simply say, “Well, mosquito, that is the purpose for which you were created. You are doing your job in biting me. I am doing my job and saying, ‘Please get out.’” You don’t stop loving the mosquito. But loving the mosquito doesn’t mean allowing it to bite you. Often people think, “Because I love that mosquito, I cannot chase it away.” That’s not so. You can love the poison, but you don’t have to swallow it.'

Only a spiritual person can go to the spiritual people’s club. If you want God, become God soon. Until you become God, you will never understand what God is. Have you ever seen God sick and dirty and eating all the wrong things? No. So you should eat what God eats. God’s altar is neat and tidy, clean, absolutely pure, not even a speck of dust. But you go to your room and it’s a junkyard. And you want God. Let your very life reflect God’s purity. Your place, your body, and your mind should be that pure, as pure as God; then you will see God. “Blessed are the pure in heart, they shall see God.” That means you have to raise yourself to that caliber. You should be that pure. Otherwise, just crying for God is not going to help you much. Think, why is it you are not getting God, you are not experiencing God? What prevents you? Eliminate all these things. Purify yourself. That’s what you call tapasya or austerity. Fire is the best purifier. There’s nothing greater than fire to burn out all the dust, all the junk. Burn yourself in the fire of the holy name. Your own mantra is a fire. Kindle it up. Let it blaze in you. Burn out all your sins and toxins. And the moment you come to the same level of purity, I don’t have to tell you what will happen to you.'

	readingtitle: 'Put Yourself in the Other Person’s Place',
	readingbody: 'Question: Often I see others making a mistake, and would like to suggest another way of handling things. How can I do it without making the other person react defensively? Sri Gurudev: Do it in a gentle way. The reason the other person becomes defensive is that you are immediately putting blame on him or her. He doesn’t want to accept that. Even if your observation is correct, he may not be able to accept it. His ego won’t allow it; so it puts a block there. That’s defense. Your body and your mind should be that pure, as pure as God; then you will see God. If you really want to help the person, first know his or her nature. Will he really accept and appreciate your advice? If you are a little doubtful but you still want to say something, just cook up a different way of presenting it. Say, “You know, I had the same problem the other day, and I had two ways to act. Thank God I went this way. If I had done it the other way I would certainly have gotten into trouble. Luckily I chose this one. I’m just sharing this with you. If you find it helpful, take it.” Put yourself in the other person’s place. There is a gentle way of saying it. If you put things like this, he or she won’t immediately feel defensive. Sometimes if you state the plain truth in plain language, you hurt the other person, and you get hurt as well. We have to learn how to communicate.'

	readingbody: 'Once upon a time there lived a king who really wanted a son. After many, many years his wife at last gave birth to a boy. The king was joyous. Immediately he called all the astrologers to learn his son’s future. Many great astrologers came to study the boy’s horoscope. Each one studied the charts. The signs were quite clear. “Sir,” the astrologers said, “your son is not a good child. Because of him you will die by the time he reaches the age of ten. In a way, he has come to kill you.” The king was furious. “You devils! You don’t even know how to cast a horoscope. Throw them all in jail.” One day an astrologer from far away came to the kingdom. The king immediately asked him to look at his son’s chart. The astrologer studied the horoscope carefully and said, “l have never seen a horoscope like this! It’s a very strong horoscope. Your son will live a long life and will be a great king. He will live for one hundred years after you have died.” This astrologer was a very clever man; he read the same chart as the others, but he presented the information in a completely different way. The king was so happy. “Shower this man with gifts. He is a great astrologer. If there is anything you want, sir, just ask me. The astrologer said “Well, there is just one request.” “Of course. What is it?” Please release those other poor astrologers from the prison. Their only crime was not being very smart. They know how to calculate, but they don’t know how to communicate. Because of this one man all the others were set free. Here education is not enough. You should know how to deal with people, how to communicate, how to live harmoniously with others. That is a great lesson that cannot be learned from books alone. Learn to live harmoniously. That is where the real joy and peace lie.'

When you work for yourself, you develop anxiety, you develop worry and fear. When you work for others there is joy. That is karma yoga, selfless service. If you really want to enjoy your work, this is the only way. Work for others or work for God, in the name of God and His creation. Just put yourself out of the picture. “I am not doing anything for myself. I don’t have to; I don’t want to. I am here to serve others.” You take care of them. If the others need your service, it’s their business to take care of you. You don’t have to worry about taking care of yourself. Remember: If you decide to take care of yourself, you are the only person to take care of you. If you let others take care of you, so many will do that. That’s the secret. Don’t worry about taking care of yourself. just think of others; then you will be taken care of.'

	readingtitle: 'If You Want to, You Can Do It',
	readingbody: 'When you want to cultivate something, you have to look for a little culture. The same is true if you want to cultivate faith. Think of all the sayings, all the great teachings and apply them in your life. Before a farmer cultivates, what does he do? He first prepares the soil by taking out all the stones and twigs, leveling the ground, loosening the soil, putting in some manure, aerating it, and then planting some good seed. In our own lives, we have to go through a similar preparation. The seeds are the good thoughts from the scriptures and the great sages and saints. Put them in and nurture them. Let them grow in your life. Cultivation is not that easy. It takes effort; but certainly if you want to, you can do it. To achieve the small things in life, you have to work very hard; but to achieve the spiritual goals, everything is done once you have that faith. When a person is trying to cultivate faith, there will be hundreds of things to come and disturb it. There will be tests. Immediately things will come to create doubt in your life. Somebody will say, “God, Enlightenment — why worry about all that? Enjoy life. You are missing so many nice things by concentrating on the spiritual life.” It is not just in this age. For millions of years the same thing has happened. There are so many temptations to forget about spirituality. “Free me from temptation,” is one of the important prayers. “Take me to the real pasture where I can graze. Do not take me into areas where I will be distracted.” Have sincere, heartfelt prayer. It is not easy to build faith. Keep praying, “God, please help me. Let me see the Truth always.”'

	readingbody: 'Even your spiritual practices are based on faith. If you didn’t have faith you wouldn’t even be practicing. Everything requires faith. That is why the scriptures say that if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can move mountains. Strong conviction is faith. If you have conviction, it is easy to accomplish what you set out to do. But before you even begin, you must be convinced. Otherwise you will just think, “Oh, okay, I’ll try to do it.” Don’t think that way. Your thought should be, “This is what I want, no matter what happens. All the rest is nothing. I won’t stop until I get it! This is the most important thing in my life.” Tests will come to see if you are really strong in your faith. Do you know how to install a flag post or a telephone post in the ground? You dig a hole and put the post in; but you don’t just leave it at that. You put stones all around and hammer it to make it strong. You hammer the ground all around, and then you try to shake the post. If it shakes, you hammer again. As long as it keeps shaking, you keep on hammering. When do you stop hammering? When it stops shaking. Life is like that. As long as you are shaking, you’ll be hammered. It’s true. God is trying to make you steady, and unless that hammering occurs you cannot be strong and steady. So don’t be afraid to face the hammering.'

I don’t know why He did that, but He must have had some reason for it. If He doesn’t want me to be foolish anymore then He will take care of it.” That is the highest form of faith. If you can’t easily develop that kind of faith, your prayer can be, “God, let me have faith in You. Let me know that You are doing everything for me. You are taking care of me. Please give me a mind that can always remember this truth. Sometimes I forget that; I know You are testing me then. Even when I forget, you are the culprit who made that happen! Still, I can’t help asking for You not to make me forget.”'

	readingtitle: 'It’s All for Good',
	readingbody: 'Once upon a time there was a king who had a wonderful, wise minister. The minister was very loyal and devoted to the king, and the king never left the palace without the minister at his side. One day, as the monarch was cutting a piece of fruit, he accidentally cut his finger. As it was being treated, he asked the minister why this had happened. “I was very careful,” he explained, “but the knife just seemed to slip all by itself.” The minister looked at him and gently said, “Don’t worry, raja. It’s all for good.” The king became furious. “What kind of philosophy is this? I have cut my finger. The blood is pouring. Yet you stand there calmly and say, ‘It’s all for good.’ If that is as much as you care about me, I don’t want you around anymore.” He called the guards and told them to take the minister to jail. The minister quietly submitted. As he was being taken away, he simply said, “Fine. This also is for good.” Several days later, the king decided to go hunting. He went far into the forest with a large group of companions. Suddenly, he started chasing a beautiful deer. Of course he had the fastest horse, and he soon left the others far behind. Still, the deer managed to escape. When the king realised how far he had gone, it was too late. He was very deep into the jungle and was lost. Fortunately the raja had been on many adventures, and he stayed calm. He was very tired and thirsty. Nearby there was a big, green tree with a small brook running past it. He drank his fill, then leaned against the tree and fell asleep. In a little while, a rustling sound woke the king. He slowly opened his eyes. What he saw made him freeze. A huge lion was standing right next to him, sniffing him all over. He didn’t know what to do so he just stayed still and watched the lion. All of a sudden, as the lion was sniffing one of the king’s hands, it snorted and ran away. The king was amazed at his good fortune. He leaped up and began shouting for his companions, who eventually found him. “Listen,” he told them. “A lion came while I was sleeping. He was huge and ferocious looking. He was all ready to eat me, but something mysteriously happened. All of sudden the lion just left.” “That’s wonderful!”, they exclaimed; but none of them could explain what had happened. When they returned to the palace, the king had the minister brought from the jail. He told the story in every detail. The minister simply said, “It’s all for good, Maharaja.” “What do you mean all for good? That doesn’t explain why the lion just went away without even biting me. What is the explanation?” “Maharaja, the lion is the king of the beasts, just as you are the king of the people. When somebody offers you a fruit, it should be a clean, wholesome fruit. The minute the lion smelled the cut finger, it knew that you were not whole, not fit. As the king of beasts, it didn’t want to eat you. So you see, raja, the cut finger saved your life. Now do you understand that it’s all for good?” “As for my imprisonment, you know that ordinarily we are never separated. Surely I would have been with you on the hunt and would have raced after you through the jungle. We would have both been sleeping under the tree when the lion arrived. He would still have rejected you, but would have swallowed me. Because you had put me in jail, my life was saved.” It is not often easy to see the good in adversity when it occurs. When you find yourself in pain, remember this story of the king and his minister. The benefit may not make itself clear until much later, but it is there. Have faith in the positive outcome. Tell yourself, “It’s all for good.” It’s like a mantra in a way. You can repeat it again and again to give you courage.'

	readingbody: 'If you think in terms of how much benefit we get just by being here on the surface of the earth, how much we get from nature, how much we get from people, how much we get from association, we receive constantly. Good thoughts, good food, good air, good rain. Even the smile from a baby is a gift. When you enjoy the smile of a baby, you are getting something from that baby. And you have to return it; although not necessarily to the same baby. You don’t have to give it back at the same place. For example, if you get a nice fruit from the top of a tree, you don’t have to go and pour water on the top of the tree. You pour water at the root of the tree. If you pour at the root you get the fruit at the top. In the same way, if you get a smile from a baby, do something to help a poor person somewhere on the road, or a sick person. Somebody who needs a little help. That will balance it out. You got a smile from the baby, and you paid it back by helping that other person. You don’t have to give it directly to the baby. We are constantly receiving. Every one of us should think, “How much am I receiving, and how much am I returning?”'

	readingbody: 'Why do people do bad things if they already know what is right and what is wrong? Because of lack of will. We know what is wrong but we don’t have the willpower to stay away from that. How can one develop the will? By discipline and by regular practice. You develop that will by doing little, little, little things. Don’t start with a big job that you cannot easily do; if you fail, you will lose confidence. Accomplishing small things will improve your self-confidence. You will be happy, “Oh, I did it.” Then one day, even the biggest thing will be the easiest thing for you. Will means application of the mind. Training the mind. Making the mind work in a positive way. It’s achieved slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. It’s easy to say, “Oh, I’m not made for that. It’s too much for me. Not everyone can do that.” Such excuses are self-delusion. Without will, we cannot achieve anything.'

	readingbody: 'Question: Is it proper to say that Jesus took the karma of man upon Himself? Is this the same as other masters’ assuming the karma of their disciples? Sri Gurudev: The masters or prophets or sages do not take away your karma. They can, but normally they don’t. Instead, they give you the strength to face your karma and purge it out. It’s not right for someone to take away your karma. You are the cause of your karma. You sowed it, and you have to reap it. What you conceived another cannot deliver. If you really believe the Bible and if you think, “Yes, Jesus took my karma the day I accepted him in my life”, then why should you even worry about it? That means you have some doubt. Why? Because it’s not that easy. The impure mind will not even allow you to accept the truth. But if you really feel, “Yes, he took my karma and I am completely free from it”, then you’re free. That doesn’t mean that he took your karma away. How did you get yourself free from karma? By faith. Your faith in Jesus washed your karma. He himself said that, did he not? “Your faith has saved you, your faith has made you whole”. If you don’t have faith, even Jesus cannot do that, and would not do that. And why can’t you have that faith? Because your own mind is still unclean. It won’t harbor that kind of faith. Though you want to have the faith, you are not yet ready. That’s why it is said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, they shall see God.” Even to have that kind of faith, you should have that kind of perfect purity.'

Anything that would affect your physical and mental peace, your health and happiness, is wrong. Anything. This might bring another question: “Suppose I want to help somebody who is troubled and that affects me. Should I do it or not?” If you are joyfully serving someone, even going through some pain doesn’t affect you. You are still happy; you are simply using a little of your energy to help someone. You can’t call that unhappiness. Sometimes when you help somebody, you feel depressed. Why is that? It is because you had expectations. “I am helping that person. The person should accept my help and get the benefit.” When you don’t see that person getting the benefit you expected, you get upset. That means it’s not a selfless act, it’s a selfish act. “I did something and I want a result.” That doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be positive thoughts behind your actions. Certainly send your prayers, think about the welfare of the person. The difference is this: you want him to be happy of course, but you don’t demand it. You are not attached to the outcome; you leave that up to God. In simple words, I would say an action without any selfish expectation whatsoever is a right action.

It really doesn’t help much to know the future. If God had wanted you to know your future, it would have been easy for Him to leave the door open. He knew that it would not be beneficial for you, so He shut the door. It’s the same for the past; it’s better if you don’t remember all the past lives. If you remembered it all, you would still have hundreds of enemies. You might forget all your friends, but you will remember your enemies. Isn’t it better to forget them? Let’s not waste time on all these things. Think of the golden present. Enjoy the present.

	readingbody: 'Question: If someone prays for something that feels good and seems right but it doesn’t happen, should the person just forget it, or keep praying? Sri Gurudev: Strictly speaking, your prayer should not be for getting something. It should not be a sort of, “I pray, You give.” That does not mean that you should not ask anything of God. You can ask, but don’t demand. Say, “Lord, I don’t know what’s best. I might even be asking for the wrong thing. So if it is Your Will, if You think it’s good for me, then please give it to me.” We are nothing but puppets. The force that we call the Cosmic Mother functions through you, through me, through everything — even a speck of dust, or an atom. We say that, but it’s not enough. We have to feel it. If we just have that feeling, then whatever we do will become spiritual practice because we are not doing it. If someone else does something to you, you should say, “Oh, whatever Mother is doing is Mother’s business. She shuffles the cards.” Then who is your friend, who is your enemy? We are all one and the same motivated by that power. If you want to pray, say a prayer to God to help you to remember this truth. In praying for others, we should feel, “Mother, You are putting a desire in my mind to pray for another, so I am praying.” Even the idea to pray for someone comes from that Cosmic Source. Otherwise, how could you pray? The good feelings to wish others well come from that Mother. The power to pray comes from that Mother. The words to pray come from that Mother. The thought has come from the Mother. Even the energy with which you pray comes from that Mother. How can you say, “I am praying for that,” as if the Mother were waiting for your prayer to cure that person? As if that person would be doomed without your prayer. That’s another subtle form of ego.'

That is something more precious to me than everything in the world. You may call it escapism or blind faith. Whatever it is, I am retaining my peace. That’s what I want. Because of that peace, I am always joyful and happy. I don’t need to worry about anything. If you have peace and joy, what else do you want?'

Samatvam yoga ucyate: Equanimity of mind is Yoga. You can always maintain that. That is what you call purity of heart. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,” says the scripture. What is purity? Staying neutral, not taking sides, keeping your calm, that is the real secret of healthy and happy living. It’s possible. And it’s not the monopoly of only a few people, ascetics living in the Himalayas, growing a long beard. You can do that. Everybody can do that. It’s our birthright.

	readingbody: 'Question: You often say, “Don’t do anything that would disturb your peace.” If someone has an irrational fear, should he or she try to get over it by doing the feared thing, even though this might disturb the person’s peace? Sri Gurudev: In this situation you are consciously trying to get over a phobia. At first, facing it will cause a disturbance; but you should welcome that kind of disturbance. Why? Because the phobia is disturbing you all the time, and this other disturbance is purposely created by you in order to make you well. You are getting some pain in order to get a real gain. If you understand that you are doing it for ultimate benefit, the temporary disturbance of your peace is not going to affect you. The ultimate motive is more important. Though on the surface you might seem to be getting more disturbed for a short time, within yourself you feel happy about it. There’s nothing wrong with getting disturbed in such a way for a good cause.'

We often use the Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra. It isn’t even asking for someone to be healed; rather it says, “Let him rise above these mortal limitations.” It’s a good, positive thought you are sending. That way he or she is benefited by your good thoughts, and you are also benefited because you are showing your love. The more you show love and concern to other people, the purer your heart becomes.'

That’s what bedtime stories are for, so that the children won’t have anything disturbing in their minds. The stories should be something like this: “Slowly, the child gave herself into the hands of God. God put her on His lap. He gently rocked the child and sang a beautiful song. Softly He said, ‘Sleep, baby. Sleep, sleep, sleep.’ The baby was soon sleeping, and…” It should be a soft, sweet story. The child will imagine that there is a baby resting in God’s arms, and God is putting the baby to sleep. He will listen to that story, and when the baby in the story falls asleep, your child will fall asleep too.'

Where are you going to go? It happens that we are together. You are my baby, I am your mother; so let’s do our job well. You do your job, I’ll do my job. You have done it today, you are sleeping today.” In that simple lullaby there is a great spiritual philosophy. “You are pure, you are absolutely clean, you are not tainted by anything. You are that Self. All the rest is just illusion.” You might wonder if the child can understand. Simply say it; the child will understand you. The child understands better than many of us. When we can’t understand the child, we think the child cannot understand us. Even when the child is in the womb, we can educate it in this way. So instead of simply making all kinds of funny sounds, “Rockabye baby in the treetops,” sing a beautiful peace chant: “Hari OM” or “OM Shanti.” Let all the babies sleep listening to OM Shanti.'

	readingbody: 'Once two children were talking to each other. One child said, “If you show me where God is, I’ll give you an apple.” The other child looked around and said, “I’ll give you two apples if you show me where God is not!” God as holy vibration is everywhere. It is not that you are filling a place with that holy vibration; you are making it express, making it shine more. Imagine a plain stone. Keep rubbing it and it will begin to shine. It will reflect light. If you just leave it crude, it won’t reflect the light. By polishing it more, you make it express what was always there. There are holy vibrations in every place, but it is in our hands to make it a holy place. Sometimes, even if it is a holy place, if we don’t reinforce that sanctity, the place will slowly lose its expression of holiness. If you begin to do business or carry on worldly matters there, eventually that high vibration will no longer shine forth. The vibration is to be brought out and expanded. It is the people who come with good intentions and do the spiritual practices who bring out the holy vibrations already existing in a place. In essence, it is the people coming to worship who make it holy. Some places are holy even before people come to worship there. That is due to the birth of a saint or an event in the life of a saint that took place there. Many holy places are the spots where the bodies of saints are buried. Because their entire personality vibrates with that holy vibration, their bodies are not cremated. Instead, the body is buried so that everything the saint used or touched — including the body — will be there to keep on emitting that holiness. It is because of the presence of the saint that the place manifests that vibration.'

If you just leave it casually somewhere and don’t treat it properly, slowly it will lose its energy. All those objects are charged, knowingly or unknowingly, by the touch or use of the holy people. Relics and other items do have these vibrations. As long as they are kept with reverence and respect, they will emit more and more vibrations.'

If you vow to wake up every morning at 4:30 for meditation, suddenly you will feel so tired. You will only want to sleep. If you vow to treat your spouse as God, probably at first he or she will look just like a god to you. Maybe for a few days he will act like God also. Then all of a sudden, that same God will turn into something terrible! Even then, don’t waver in your vow; continue to think of him or her as God. That’s your test.

Even in hell, such a person will be at ease. A healthy person hates no one, dislikes nothing. Total love, universal love emanates from within. There is no tension anywhere, no stress or friction. These are the signs of real health. A person who is healthy doesn’t hurt anyone. He or she is not afraid of anyone. Not only is he unafraid, but he sees that others are not afraid of him. The “others” include animals, plants, everything. A healthy person emits always and only a loving and pure vibration. A really healthy person takes everything in life as a game. Whether we win or lose, it’s still a game. Often people forget that. In a way, I feel that losing is a better game. Why? If you lose, you allow the other person to win. When the other person wins, what do you see? A winning face. When you win and the other fellow loses, what do you see? A losing face. There is great joy in losing and making the other person win and have a happy face. Who will be the happiest person? The one who brings happiness to others. That means our minds should be well balanced under all conditions. That is yoga.'

If you were not there the employer would still have a business, but you would not have a job. So the employee should always be grateful to the employer and honestly fulfill the duties he has been given. Don’t always think about how much the employer is giving you; think about how much you should give. Give all that you can. If you honestly do that, you will melt his heart.

If there’s no employer, there’s no employee. The only difference is “er” and “ee.” So the employer should know that if he or she doesn’t take care of the employees, he cannot survive; he cannot grow. He should think, “Yes, it’s an opportunity for me to serve the people. God has given me some wealth, some intelligence, and with these I am doing a job; through this business, I am taking care of all these people.” He should feel, “I am serving them,” not that he is helping them. God is the only one who can help us all; so each of us serves the other. And the employer should not take all the money and go to Las Vegas. He should convert that money by giving it back to the employees and taking care of their welfare so that they can keep working. It’s a mutual give and take. Each one, employer and employee, should think of the welfare of the other.'

Sri Gurudev: That’s where you should learn to apply moderation; be neither too tight nor too loose. If you can’t figure it out by yourself, seek the aid of someone who can help you. Consult a more experienced person. Every situation you come across will be different. When you say, go with the flow, do you mean the flow of the world? If so, then that’s not a good idea. Don’t just go with the flow of the world. Go with the flow of the people who are going in the right direction. Join them. Get into their boat. The company you choose will help you in many, many ways. Unfortunately, in the name of making a little money or feeding ourselves, we sometimes put ourselves in a terrible situation, or in the wrong atmosphere. We think that finding a little food and getting some money are the most important things. It’s not so. Saving yourself, raising your standards, serving others, maintaining your peace — these are the most important things in life. For the sake of these things, you should learn to give up anything that’s not necessary and to hold onto anything that is useful. If you really want to go with the flow of God, surrender yourself completely to Him. That requires real courage. Surrendering is not easy. You have to positively say, “Whatever comes to me is God’s will. I’m ready to face it, ready to accept it whatever it is, good or bad, wonderful or terrible.”'

Ideally, your companion should be somebody who has similar thinking; but if you are strong enough and won’t be affected by his or her lifestyle, it’s fine to stay with that person.

First release your soles from your shoes, have a nice shower, and put on some loose, comfortable clothing. As you loosen your body, loosen your mind also. Don’t worry about tomorrow. Know that you have done today’s job within your capacity. Talk to God: “God, by Your grace I have done something today, and I think I have finished my day. If You want me to do something tomorrow, I know You will wake me up. If You think I haven’t done my job well and I’m just creating more problems, let my sleep be longer.” Know that if God wants you to get up, you will get up the next day. With that, resign yourself completely and just relax. That will happen only when you put your trust in something higher. God sent you here; He is working through you; He has done today’s job. He may use you tomorrow. Be worriless like a baby. Don’t put too much responsibility on your shoulders.'

To get God’s Grace means to get the grace of your neighbors. God doesn’t need your worship and service directly. Worship the Creation, and you have worshipped God. Serve the Creation, and you have served God. Let us think of these points and see if we can do something to make our life a little better, a little more peaceful, a little more useful, If it not useful, at least let it be harmless.

Then instead of saying, “I am doing it,” the ego will say, “I am an instrument. I am being used by His Will.” You recognise that He is doing everything. There is nothing for you to do.

If you want to honor God, make Him happy by expressing His image, that part of God that is functioning in you. Put yourself into His hands. As the Bhagavad Gita proclaims, “Whatever you do, whatever you enjoy, whatever penance you perform, in essence everything that you think, speak, or do, do it as an offering to God.” Sri Krishna tells Arjuna, “Do it as an offering to me.” God isn’t asking for something of yours to be offered to Him. If it’s yours, why should He ask for it? The truth is, nothing belongs to us. Even our thoughts and ideas. Everything happens due to His presence in this frame. Without God’s energy, without God’s Will, you cannot even think. The intelligence that you seem to possess is not yours; it’s part of God’s intelligence. The breath that you breathe is part of God’s. The water that you drink belongs to God. The food that you eat belongs to God. Everything already belongs to God. So what is it that you are offering? Then why should Krishna say, “Do it as an offering to me”? He is saying, “If you feel that they are yours, at least offer them to me.” But it is even better to recognise that they never were yours. Ultimately you realise, “There’s nothing for me to offer. On the other hand, You are the one who is doing everything through me. Even the offering is done by You to You.” That way we really honor God. When you reach the highest level, you feel, “Everything already belongs to You. What is it that I am offering You? The only way to honor You is to know that You are honoring me by using me as Your instrument. At any time You can turn off the switch. I am thankful that You are still using me; You haven’t discarded me as a blunt tool.” Your vision takes a 180-degree turn. Instead of your honoring God, you realise that God is honoring you every minute.'

It’s not how much money we make, but how we make it that’s important. God knows how to adjust things. Sometimes we get into some unexpected trouble. You lose something, break something, or fall sick and give hundreds of dollars to the doctors. Why? Because the money that you earned was not clean, so it has to be taken away by someone.

If you believe in prayer, the hunger should just go away. If you eat, then why can’t you take medicine also? Prayer is one form of healing. We can use all the possible ways. The important thing is, don’t let others do everything for your sake. You should also do something. When people send their prayer requests here, we ask them also to pray at the same time. It’s not, “You do whatever you want, I’ll pray for you and you will get well.” That’s not right. That is interfering with karma. The people who are affected should also go through certain disciplines in life. The pain comes to make you believe in a higher spirit, a higher power. There is nothing wrong with looking for some remedy for a problem. If your karma is that strong, even with all the remedies, it won’t get cured. Then you know, yes, your karma is stronger than that.

That is possible only if you keep your mind in good shape and don’t allow it to get into mischief. Be conscious of all your actions. Before you do anything, question yourself: “What am I doing it for? To be happy, to have fun. Okay, will it be fun always or will it only be fun for a little while and then start creating problems? Will anyone be hurt by it? How long can I be happy? Will there be an end? What is the price I have to pay?” After all this analysis, if your answer is, “Yes. I will always be happy.

He has really seen your thirst in spiritual life, and He wants to make sure that you are really serious about it. Don’t you have to pass a big test before you are graduated? It’s true. So don’t think of those people as negative. An examiner is not a negative person. Your family has so much love for you; if they seem to be negative to you, don’t be negative to them in return. Just because you are together, it doesn’t mean that you have the same growth in understanding life. Each soul grows in its own way. The others may still be young in their growth; all you can do is be patient and prove the benefit of your practice by your own example.

Leave it there. Don’t push. Allow them to grow; one day they might even excel you. Very often it happens that way. So prove by your own example that you are becoming a beautiful person. Don’t argue; instead, let them see that you are being helped by what you are doing. They will be watching you. When your own life shows the wonderful benefits of your practice, they will say, “Honey, I misunderstood. I’m sorry. I see how healthy and happy this has made you. Until that time, be patient. As a spiritual person, you should see that there is harmony present in the family in all situations.'

	readingbody: 'Never give up. Know that your spiritual goal is something great. You have fallen down from the summit, and you are on your way back up. It is greater even than climbing Mount Everest. As soon as the climbers get to the peak of Everest, they have to go down again. They never rest. But with the spiritual climb, once you get there you rest there forever. This is the highest peak. Just go on, steadily climbing. If you get tired, if you see some dense clouds coming, if there is no visibility, set up camp. But don’t go back to the base. Every time you need to stop, set up camp there. When the mountain climbers cannot continue, do they go back to the bottom and start over again the next day? No. What you gain, you should not lose. Whenever necessary, stop, build yourself up, regain your strength; and when the storm has cleared, continue to go forward. The mind also has storms. Sometimes the storm is so violent that nothing seems to help; not even reading scriptures or repeating your mantra. It doesn’t matter; just don’t give up. Stay in the camp and wait for the storm to pass. Make a resolution, “I will march forward a step at a time, no matter how slowly. I am never going to turn back. Even if I am not going to achieve anything in this life, it doesn’t matter. I’ll continue in the next life and the one after that, and the one after that. Never, never will I turn back.” That kind of courage is necessary. It’s a big task. The hardest thing in the world is to train one’s own mind.'

	readingbody: 'Question: If we have faith in God, do we need medicine when we are sick? Sri Gurudev: Medicine is also a gift from God. Prayer, medicine, and certain dietetic discipline could all be used at the same time. Even food is a kind of medicine for the pain of hunger. Do you say that if you believe in prayer, then you should not feel hunger? No. If you eat to relieve hunger, you can also take advantage of medical science when necessary. We can use all the things God has given us, as long as we use them properly. Whatever method of healing you use, don’t expect someone else to do all the work for you. A doctor shouldn’t just give a pill and say, “Go ahead — smoke all you want, continue to overeat, drink all the alcohol you want and don’t exercise. This pill will make you better.” No. If necessary, the patient can have some medicine, but he or she should make whatever changes are needed to have good health. When people send prayer requests to us, we ask them to pray also. It isn’t: “You go ahead and do whatever you want. I’ll pray for you and you’ll get well.” That’s not right. That’s interfering with someone’s karma. The people who are affected should practice certain disciplines. There is nothing wrong in looking for some remedy for a problem. If your karma is really strong, even with all the remedies, the ailment won’t get cured. If that happens, you should know it’s because of some karma and accept it. If somebody comes to help you, then your karma is bringing somebody to help. You should accept that too.'

You just give yourself into the hands of God. “God, I’m coming to You completely empty-handed. You do anything You want with me.” There is a great benefit in that. Only then do you realise that He is with you every minute. You feel God as you would feel your own breath, your own heartbeat. Even one little distraction is enough to keep you from experiencing that presence. Saint Ramakrishna gave a very beautiful, very simple example of this. When you want to thread a needle, you have to insert all of the fibers at the same time. If even one tiny fiber sticks out, the thread won’t go in. All of the fibers must be well twisted and concentrated; then it is easy to thread the needle. So if even one little fiber gets distracted, separated from your concentration, that will prevent you from entering into God. It’s very difficult to achieve this kind of concentration. That’s why you don’t see many great sages and saints around. How many are ready to give up all these little distractions for God?'

Immediately the devotee started fighting for his breath. When the saint realised that he would not be able to stay under the water any longer, he let him up. As the young man stood gasping on the riverbank, Sri Ramakrishna asked him, “What were you thinking while you were in the water? Were you thinking of your money, your wife, your son, your name, your fame, your profession?” “All I was thinking about was a little air!” “Aha. When you can think of God like that, you’ll see Him right away.” Now you know what kind of one-pointed yearning for God is required. I don’t expect everyone to get to that point right away, but at least you should know why you are not seeing God. You can’t blame anyone else for it. Although sometimes people try to. They blame the technique or the teacher or the mantram. You really don’t even need any technique, any mantram, anything, if you have that kind of one-pointed mind.'

Then, if I give them peace, they will really relish it.” That is why we are looking for peace. We have had enough of fights and problems. If you realise this, you can begin right in your own home. Love your family, your pets, your plants. Do not treat them as something different from yourself. They all have the same essence, the same spirit. If we want to show the unity in diversity, that is where we can begin. At home, with our pots and pans. You may be angry with your husband or wife, but do not put the pot down with a bang. Be gentle. See the same spirit in everything. That is unity in diversity. There is nothing without life in this world. Be gentle, be nice, be loving. See your own Self in all and treat everything properly. That is how to show the unity in diversity visibly and powerfully. A real spiritual experience means to see the unity in diversity.'

So “Think of God;” but how can you think of God without knowing what God is? We don’t know what God is. All that we know about God is not really God. We only think in terms of what we have heard or read or assumed. In yogic understanding, what is God? Peace. Peace is God. So think of peace always. That means, remember that there is always peace in you. Think of your positive nature. Always affirm, “I am peaceful, I am joyful,” and act accordingly. If you constantly think in that way, then you won’t be running after things to be happy. That is the thought that we should constantly keep in mind.

A monastic vow is a commitment. Even friendship is a commitment. Life itself is a commitment. If you make a vow and honestly try, and find you cannot live up to it, you need not feel guilty about it. Because if you feel guilty then you lose your courage, your strength of mind. But if you make a promise to somebody and if you fail in your promise and by that you affect someone else’s life, then certainly you will feel guilty and the karma will affect you. Without commitment in life we can never grow. Commitment is a way of training the mind and making it obey you. You become the master of your mind. Who wants to break the commitment? Your mind. The mind pops up, “Oh, I don’t want to do it,” and you give up. Then wherever you go, whatever you do, the mind will have that same tendency. Think before you leap. Once you leap, that’s it. Stick to it, whatever it is. Your dynamic will should be applied. “Yes, I decided to do it. I am going to do it.

	readingbody: 'A fearless person is the one who is afraid of God. What is meant by “fear of God?” Fear of God’s law, or the Cosmic Law. That means you know the Cosmic Law, what action will bring what result, and you are afraid of doing a wrong action. Fear is created for that purpose. If you keep on doing the right thing, you come to see that you don’t need to be afraid of anything. You become fearless. So begin with fear and ultimately become fearless. The fear is necessary. When you go near a flame you know that it will burn, and you are careful. That is what you call fear. Knowing and staying away from the wrong is what you call fear. The real fearless state is when you see everyone as your own Self. When you see yourself in others you are not afraid of them. In realising that oneness, you rise above the fear totally. As long as there’s duality, you are afraid. You are afraid of your own body sometimes, your own mind sometimes, because you see them as different than you. Two means fear. One means no fear. That spiritual oneness is to be recognised. Until then, we are afraid.'

There is no contradiction at all. But you should understand the purpose of your prayer. You don’t go and ask God, “Give me that”. If you feel you must ask for something, then say, “Please give me understanding. Give me the constant remembrance that You are handling everything, that You will give me everything I deserve, and You will never give anything to me if I don’t deserve it.” If God is going to do something only after you request it, what kind of God is that? “Oh, because ten people are praying for you, because I got ten thousand signatures, I am giving you this.” No. But when ten thousand people feel sorry for a person and pray, all that wishful thinking goes to help him or her. Good thoughts and feelings always reach the ones who are really starving for them. Those who really deserve that good thinking will receive it. We simply spread the seeds. When people know that so many others are praying for them, that gives them strength. There is a benefit right away, “Oh, so many people are praying for me. I should really get well. All their good thinking is on my side.” Prayerful thoughts always bring benefit to people.'

Don’t ever forget that. What was put together will get separated one day. But don’t you cut it. If at any time it has to be cut, let the One who put it together do the cutting. And don’t worry about catastrophes. If something has to happen, let it happen. It’s all up to God. “I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid!

The radio should be tuned to the same frequency as the transmitting station. God is transmitting His energy, His beauty, His love, His grace, everything at this OM frequency. If you want to receive it, where should you tune your radio? To the same OM. That is why mantra meditation is a very important practice. All other practices are secondary when compared with mantra repetition. Mantra repetition is a direct way to tune yourself to that cosmic vibration. Even if you don’t do any of the other practices you should not miss mantra repetition. That alone will help you a lot. Every day, at least three times — morning, noon, and evening — if not more, you should produce that sound by repeating your mantra.

If your body is strong enough, you don’t have to be allergic to anything. Think of all the people who live in a tropical climate where there is heat and humidity. Fortunately the body is able to accept any condition, to withstand and adapt, because it’s made that way. How many people poison their systems, and their bodies accept it? The body even accepts smoking and drinking. Keep the body in good shape. That means giving it the proper exercise and eating the right food in the right quantity. Above all, have the proper thoughts.

One day, as the attendant was bringing the elephant back to the palace, a little boy came walking up to the elephant. He took its trunk in his hands, saying, “Stop! Look at the way you are walking. The elephant stopped. “Walk gently, carefully,” he told the elephant. He let go of the trunk, and the elephant started walking again. The next day as the elephant passed the same spot, the boy came running and stopped the elephant to reprimand it again. This happened several days in a row. The attendant couldn’t believe what was happening. He told the king, who sent his minister to check on the boy. In a few days, the minister came to report to the king. “Sir, I observed the boy. He lives with his grandmother. He’s just a playful little boy. He seems ordinary, but he has absolutely no fear. That’s why he can stop your elephant. I can’t believe it,” said the king. “What do you mean?” Sir, a mind without fear and worry can do anything.” The king wanted the minister to prove his point. The only way to do so was to make the boy worry about something. The minister approached the boy’s grandmother. After hearing from her that the boy was allowed to do anything he wanted, the minister asked, “Has he ever asked for anything and been refused?” No. I have given him everything that he wanted. He is just a happy-go-lucky boy.” Is he afraid of anything?” Nothing at all.” The minister had to prove his theory to the king, so he said, “Alright. When he comes home today give him the usual food, but add less than the usual amount of salt. If the boy asks about it, tell him that you don’t have enough money to buy salt, so you had to be sparing with what you have left.” The grandmother said, “If the king wants me to do that, I shall do it.” That evening when the boy came home, she serve his supper right away. After a few bites, the boy said, “Grandma, what is this? It’s not tasty today.” The grandmother repeated what the minister had told her, and the boy said, “Okay, Grandmother, I will get you some salt.” He ran to the shop and asked the shopkeeper to give him a little salt. The shopkeeper explained that he couldn’t give him salt without receiving money in exchange. “Where can I get some money?” the boy asked. You have to go and work for it.” I don’t know how to work.” Then you can’t get any salt.” The boy was a little depressed. He went home. “Grandma, I don’t know what to do. He wants me to go and work and get money so I can get some salt. I don’t know how to work.” Alright, sweetheart,” said the grandmother, “it doesn’t matter. Go to sleep. We’ll talk about it tomorrow.” The boy went to bed, but he couldn’t sleep all night. In the morning, the elephant came as usual, and as usual, the boy went to stop the elephant, but he couldn’t do it. The elephant pushed him aside and walked off. All the young fellow had in mind was, “I couldn’t get a little salt for my food.” That one small worry had taken away all his strength.'

There is also a nice, tasty jelly inside, the tender kernel before it hardens; but it takes a big machete to open the shell. Sometimes people don’t have a big machete so they just drink the water and throw the rest of the coconut away. When the monkeys see a discarded coconut, they know that there is something nice inside. One of them will come, slowly put a hand inside, and grab that tender kernel. But when the monkey tries to pull its hand back out, the hand gets caught. You see? The hand is now a fist clutching the prize and it’s bigger than when it went in. The monkey screams and runs around, but still it holds onto the kernel. Sometimes the monkey’s wrist will even get cut and bleed. Still, it won’t let go because it’s eager to eat that treat. It continues to hold the kernel tight, and continues to run around screaming, screaming, screaming. At last the monkey gets really tired and stops running; but it still holds on. Finally when it is so exhausted that it loses its capacity to do anything, slowly the grip loosens and the hand slips out. Many of us are like those monkeys. We hold some attachment tightly and say, “I don’t want it! I don’t want it! I’m tired. I want to get out of this!” When you are really tired, you will let go.'

Remember, even when there have been catastrophes, this world has still gone on. And it still continues. How big is your world? Do you think it’s a big world? If you compare your world to the entire cosmos, your world is not even equal to one hundredth of a mustard seed, remember that. By the time I answer your question, do you know how many worlds like this will be reduced to pieces somewhere in the galaxy? Every minute stars fall, planets are destroyed and then rebuilt again. I remember someone once asked a scientist, “How big is our world? How many galaxies are there in the whole cosmos?” Do you know what he said? There was a big, beautiful, shaggy dog with long hair sitting nearby and the scientist said, “If you shave all of this dog’s hair as close to the skin as possible, and then chop the hairs into tiny, tiny pieces, and count those pieces you will have counted one hundredth of the total galaxies in the cosmos.” Can you perceive that number? The mind cannot even begin to grasp it. So don’t worry about these changes. Today you are happy and comfortable, and if you can do something to make someone else also happy and comfortable, do it. If you cannot do it, at least don’t make others miserable. If you can’t make others happy, at least don’t make them unhappy by thinking about catastrophes, and this and that. Even if everything breaks up, you  will remain. What is that “you?” The unbreakable one, the soul, your consciousness, which you call the Self. That always remains because consciousness never changes. The consciousness is always there, but it expresses itself in various ways using various forms, being called by various names. So as the Self, you are immortal. Don’t be afraid of anything. You are eternal.'

Those things are all good no doubt, but they are not the end-all. If you have it, fine. But the real mark of spiritual life is the thirst for knowledge. You cry for God. The Upanishads say, “Not by doing a lot of things, not by acquiring book knowledge, not even by charity, not by progeny, not by any of these things can we experience that great Truth, the immortal principle, but by total, total renunciation, total dedication.” A mind completely free from any sort of “I, me, mine”, is the one and only qualification. “Tyagat shanthir anantaram.” That means that God in the form of shanti, peace, will reside in you always. And you will be able to experience that only when you have tyaga, dedication in your life. Renounce the selfishness. This is the teaching. All the other things are there just to keep the student busy. If you come one day and I say, “This is all: Renounce your selfishness and you will realise the Self”, then you will say, “What is this? I went there and I wanted to learn something. He simply told me this and sent me out. He didn’t teach me scriptures, Hatha Yoga.

You are really the Father of fathers, and ‘Father knows best!’ I am cleaning my house and preparing for Your arrival to take residence. Please come and give whatever You want, whenever You want, however You want. I leave all that to You.” That is the best form of communication. We shouldn’t be demanding, expecting, even imagining. Simply say, “I am doing my job, I know You will do Your job.” The best form of devotion is that.'

	readingbody: 'Once a pretty young girl was stung by a scorpion. It happened on a mountain top, at evening time. To go to the clinic down below, you had to descend a thousand steps. There were mostly monks and spiritual aspirants around, and everyone was trying to figure out what to do. The girl was lying on the ground crying, and her mother also was crying. A renunciate is not supposed to touch a girl, so the monks were planning to get a stretcher or something on which to move her. As they were planning, I said, “This is all foolishness. “I grabbed her, put her on my shoulder and ran down the hill to the clinic. The doctor immediately gave her an injection, after which she calmed down and fell asleep. But all the people around started gossiping, “Look at that swami. How could he carry a girl like that? Look at the way he hugged her.” For four or five days this was bubbling, and it slowly reached my Gurudev, Swami Sivanandaji. During his next talk he looked at the sannyasis and said, “Ahh. Who is hugging the girl now? You or him? True, he carried her down the hill, but he put her down at the clinic. All of you are still carrying her.”'

	readingtitle: 'God Gives You What You Want',
	readingbody: 'I read a beautiful piece of wisdom recently: “When God wants to punish you, He will give you everything that you ask for.” He gives you what you want, even though it may not be good for you. Unfortunately, we still don’t know what to want. We want many, many things; we want all the things that bring us problems. So we are the cause of our problems. When someone has a problem you say, “Ahh, he asked for it.” We don’t even know what to ask for. So the best prayer would be, “God, I don’t know what to ask for. I may even ask for the wrong thing, I’m still a child. As a good father, good mother, You know what is beneficial for me. You give me what I need. Please don’t give me what I want. I will accept whatever You give me. And I will accept what You take away from me. You are the giver, You are the taker.” If you allow God to take things from you whenever He wants, you will never make a mistake in your life. What is God’s duty? To give the proper result for your action. That is nature’s law. Then why does God allow people who do good things to suffer and people who do bad things to get what they want? Those people are good now, but they were not good before. And the others once did something to deserve what they are getting now, even though it might have been long before. That is an important point that we miss in the West. We are slowly beginning to understand that, “Yes, we lived before and we will be still living after.” There is life before birth, and life after death. The soul is immortal. It simply goes through different bodies to gain more experiences. You carry all your past actions and their results with you.'

	readingbody: 'What we earned in the previous life we bring to this life. And in this life we are earning more. If we have done a lot of bad actions before, and suffered the results, we learned, “Yes, I shouldn’t be doing anything bad.” Now you are a good person, but that doesn’t mean that all of the bad things you did before are going to be forgotten. No. You have to answer for them. You are good now, you were bad before. So your sufferings are the result of your past bad actions. Your good actions will bring good results later on. But if you don’t believe in that you say, “Oh, why is a good man suffering like this? Look at that bad man, he is enjoying life.” He was good before, so he enjoys all that now. If he doesn’t have time to face the results of his present actions in this very life itself, he will certainly face them in the next life. That is the theory of karma. No one can escape from that. So God is not responsible for the karma. God is only responsible for seeing that what you sow, you reap. That’s all. If you put your finger in the fire, it will burn you. The fire is not responsible for that. The function of fire is to burn. You can use the fire for a good purpose or for a bad purpose. It’s up to you. So let us not blame God for everything. God is a neutral energy, like electricity. Plug in a lamp, you get light. Plug in your finger, you get a shock. You cannot label electricity as good or bad. You can use it for any purpose.'

They love the animals, the plants, all the things around them. They even love their trash cans. That’s what heaven is. Everyone living as one big family with no “mine” and “yours,” only “ours.” It’s God’s home and everyone feels that they are children of that home. Everything is common. Everybody takes care of every thing. It’s a collective life. Even if one individual is unhappy, everybody takes care of that person and sees that he or she becomes happy again. Our property is common, our money is common, our kitchen is common, our school is common. In a way, everything belongs to everybody. That’s how people live in heaven. If we could live that way, certainly we would leave a heaven here. And that is exactly what yogic life means. Living a collective life. Rising above selfishness. Sharing the joy of everyone, and the pain of everyone. Of course such a thing may not happen overnight. It might take a lot of effort because we have been brought up with this “I, me, mine, that’s mine, that’s yours,” consciousness. We have to slowly undo all that now. We have our independence, our individuality; but our independence should not interfere with the independence of others. Different individuals live together like the flowers in a bouquet. They may appear to be different, but they have a common purpose: serving each other and collectively serving humanity. That is our aim. Whatever we do should be done in this light.'

If you think, “I didn’t do my best; somebody else did that best through me, and somebody else made the mistake,” then you are not responsible for doing the best or doing the worst. Literally speaking, none of us is doing anything here. There’s only one doer: the Cosmic Intelligence that does everything and works through everybody. That is what put me here and is making me talk, and has put you there, and is making you listen — just because the show must go on. If we can understand this, life will be a super heaven for us.

Still, your taking rest is for the purpose of serving. That’s how you should eat, sleep, rest, bathe, everything. You take a bath with a nice soap not just to make yourself clean. You have to come here with a clean body so that you won’t send out a bad odor to others. It is for the sake of others that you are keeping your body clean. It is to serve others that you eat your lunch. It is to serve others tomorrow that you go and rest tonight. We should think, “Everything I do is aimed towards serving others, my all is for others”. If we can apply this in our daily lives then we don’t have to worry about taking care of ourselves. Each one is already taken care of by everyone else. Even being overly enthusiastic in wanting to serve more is the wrong approach. That’s egoism. You should simply serve in whatever way you can. Don’t try to show off. Don’t pretend that you can do more than you are able to. A parrot can talk to you, but not a donkey. Does the donkey get upset over it? No. It’s happy as a donkey. It need not try to copy the parrot and then cry, “Oh, I can’t even sing or repeat anything”. If you have been created as a donkey, be happy as a donkey, because you have a purpose. If you have been made something else, be happy that way.'

If you still feel that you have to liberate yourself, the only liberation to be achieved is to liberate the mind from the selfishness that creates all these disturbances in the mind.

God is not the only one that speaks to you. There’s some other fellow inside who also whispers to you. That fellow is your own ego. You can hear the voice of your own ego. Then, of course, you would ask, “How can I distinguish between them?” There is a testing stone for that. When God tells you something it is for your benefit as well as for everyone else’s benefit. Nobody gets hurt when God asks you to do something. It’s good for all. But if your ego says something, there is always something sneaky about it. There is a tinge of selfishness. You have to get something first, “Don’t worry about others. Get it!” Yes. So, that is the testing stone. “Is it selfish or selfless? Is it for everybody’s benefit or will someone get hurt by it?” If it would hurt somebody, God would never say that to you. God loves everyone equally. He’s not interested in hurting someone else to make you happy. Remember that. God also speaks to you through your own conscience. The conscience in you, in me, and in the other person will never differ because they are all from the same God. That’s why sometimes when you do not know which voice is correct, you can go to somebody who you think is following God’s advice within. But before you do that make sure that that person follows the true guidance of God in his life.'

Someday you will have an old body, and one day you will even have a dead body. But still, you have a body. It’s the body that goes through all these changes. You  are immortal. Identify with that real you, the real “I.” When you play soccer, you kick the ball around. The ball goes through all the motions, but you are doing the playing. You enjoy the movements of the ball. Likewise, let your mind be your soccer ball. Wherever it goes, just enjoy it. Even to enjoy nice, beautiful writing on a board, the board should be black because the chalk is white. You enjoy the white writing because there is a black board behind it. Don’t forget that. You enjoy the pain because there is pleasure behind it. We are the knowers, we are the seers. Remember that truth always. Apply this whenever you are in a depressed state. Jump up, shake it off and say, “Hey, l am a lion! This is all just temporary. I have come across this before and l know it will go away.” You can heal yourself. There is a beautiful part of the mind, a powerful part of the mind, that can always get you out of any problem.

A lotus flower grows in very shallow water, usually in a muddy area. Though it comes out of the mud and mire, it rises as a beautiful flower that lives in the water without being affected by it. The lotus flower is always given as an example for one who wants to live spiritually in the world. It is said, “Live like a lotus in the water.” The lotus leaf is right in the water, but it’s never moistened by the water. When you pick it up, it’s completely dry. It never gets wet. If you throw a little water over it, the water will roll off and scatter around like pearls. A person should live like the lotus, being in the world but not affected by it. You should always express your natural beauty, though you may grow in a dirty place. Nothing from outside should affect you. The lotus is a symbol of love and devotion also. If you ever see the Goddesses Lakshmi or Saraswati you would see that they’re standing on a lotus. Wherever Lord Buddha placed his foot, a lotus appeared to hold it. The feet of a holy person are called the “lotus feet.” The lotus flower turns its head towards the sun always. That means it always turns towards the light; it receives the light constantly. So you can say it’s an ever-enlightened flower.'

But it is not something that has to be brought in from outside. Happiness is already within us, and is to be experienced. No one can bring us liberty, bring us happiness. The founding fathers made the Declaration of Independence, but did they bring us liberty? Did they bring us happiness? They could not. They could only guide us, as all the great men and women do. We have to follow that guidance. The Declaration is a beautiful expression of age-old religious truth. We are all made in God’s image, says the Bible. If we want to experience that joy within, we have to liberate ourselves from our own self-made bondage. Nobody on earth is interested in binding you. Even if someone were interested, nobody could do that. It’s completely in your hands to be bound or to be free. Bondage is not real. If you think that you are bound, you are bound. If you think that you are free right this moment, and that from time immemorial you have never been bound, then you are free. You feel that freedom. So, the freedom or the joy of freedom has to come from right thinking — from not thinking that you are bound. Who is a free person? The one who is interested in liberating himself or herself from self-made bondage.'

They didn’t even bother to say, “Let Americans be free,” but, “Let all be free. Let everyone and everything enjoy freedom.” But of course if we can’t think in those terms, at least let us think small to begin with and then keep expanding. That’s what we are trying to achieve here. Every individual is a Yogaville. You have problems within you. You have to have board meetings within you. All the outside meetings are ultimately to happen within. Just as the board people sit and analyse, analyse your own problems. For that sake your energy should really fly high. That is why the first and foremost thing is to hoist the flag. The flag is nothing but the kundalini or the sum total of consciousness within you rising up to the crown chakra at the top of the head. It should flutter there. You awaken the kundalini and let it unfurl and rise through your flagpost which is the spinal column. The string that you draw to raise the flag is your breath. One string comes down, one goes up: the incoming and outgoing breath. Lift up your energies. You cannot analyse and find the solution when your energies are low.'

But even to do the service correctly, with the proper attitude, with proper physical energy, you have to tune up your body and mind. If the battery is weak, your quartz clock won’t run. You have to charge your battery. That’s where the personal practices come in. Snatch a little bit of time somehow to wind your clock, and then throughout the day you can unwind. It seems to be the other way around. In your activities, you get wound up. You should be unwinding. Make a new resolution that, “Yes, I am going to let my flag fly. Let it rise up my flagpost, through my practices.” Keep the post straight by the yoga postures. Pull the strings by proper breathing. Raise the flag of consciousness.

The music is there, but if you tune to the wrong station you will get atmospheric disturbance. Both are there. You call it “disturbance” because you don’t want it, but it is there. The music also is there. So we simply tune to receive. Sometimes even without your conscious effort, the tuner of your receiving set seems to be in a certain location; all of a sudden it receives and then you say, “Oh, I am experiencing something new. I never thought of that before.” It just comes to you, even without your conscious effort, because the mind simply rolls to that frequency and happens to receive it.

Therefore, all these things should make you unhappy. I’m sorry, it’s a little hard hearted to say this. Everything must ultimately cheat you and deceive you, and hit you so hard that you turn back to God. And that’s what will happen to a sincere seeker. That’s God’s Will. In a way, when people are not ready to realise God, they will even be tempted to go out and chase things. And they will be given that piecemeal happiness here and there. When people find real pleasure in the world outside, it shows that God is not in a hurry to get them. It’s true. If God is in a hurry to get you, He will make you displeased with everything outside very soon. If you look at the life history of the saints, you will find that the minute they become God-conscious they got into all kinds of problems, suffering after suffering, suffering after suffering. Why?

Of course, since you remember that you got the light from another lamp, you are grateful to that light. This is why we dedicate a special day each year in honor of all the great masters, sages, and saints. They were flaming torches. We touch them in some form or other and get a little spark. We humble ourselves in front of those great sages and saints and express our gratitude, and by doing that we are able to receive more. We give our gratitude to our mothers on Mother’s Day and our fathers on Father’s Day. In the same way we give our gratitude to the spiritual teacher, or the guru, who ultimately helps us to realise the final goal: the Truth, or God, or the inner Light. So Guru Poornima Day, or All Prophets Day, is not just a mere celebration. It is an observance. You observe the day, and you receive the benefit.

Karma is not something that somebody gave you. Nobody creates karma for you. You have the capacity to erase it and purge it out. Have this idea well rooted in your system: “It’s my karma. I acquired it, and I can remove it. I can be done with that. Nobody else is the cause for my karma.” Then you can comfortably work on it. But if your energy is not enough, the karma seems to win. Still, it has it’s own time period. After having given its reward to you, whether pleasurable or painful, it gets purged out and ceases. So have confidence and continue to work on it. Take your time and be patient. Nothing is impossible. You can heal yourself because you created your disease. Now, you can create your health. You are the master of it. Never give up. Fast.

You will be urged to do something — possibly something very different. When your true temperament comes out, then you will know that’s the real you. Sit and question yourself, “What is it that I am naturally interested in?” The Bhagavad Gita calls it swadharma — the natural tendency or natural temperament. Sometimes you might come across a sort of natural temperament that is not fit for your growth. You might have been developing in the wrong way before. But remember, even your natural temperament was not given to you by someone else. It’s yours. You made it before, and you brought it with you. Now, after learning and studying and knowing a little bit more, you might think, “That’s not the right temperament for me to develop; that may be what I came with, but it’s not conducive anymore, so I’m going to change it.” That’s where you exercise your mastery. If you are strong enough, you can brush it all aside completely and open up a new chapter in your life. You are the master of your destiny. You can do it, you can undo it, and you can do it differently. Don’t ever, ever blame your environment on somebody else: “Oh, my Dad used to do this, my Mom used to do this, so I am like this.” They probably did it because that’s what they knew. You don’t have to be influenced by that. Always use your temperament in doing something beautiful, something beneficial for the entire humanity.

What makes it a false God? It’s not somebody else worshipping God in some other form that makes it a false God to you. When you don’t see God in something, it becomes a false God then. It’s still God’s manifestation, but because of superficial things you don’t see it that way. Then it becomes a false God to you. People should see everything as God’s expression; they should worship, adore, love, respect, and approach it that way.'

	readingbody: 'Selfishness is when you feel, “I must have it at any cost.” Use your discriminating faculty. Analyse your motives. “Why am I selfish? What am I gaining out of that?” By being selfish, you are not going to be happy at all. Selfishness makes you miserable. Any time you are unhappy, if you look for the cause, you will see that you were selfish in doing things, in your approach, or in your thinking. That’s why a selfish person can never, never, never be happy. In a way everything is selfish, no doubt. Even wanting to be peaceful at all times is selfish. You want peace and health so that you can grow spiritually; it sounds selfish. But that kind of selfishness is not wrong. If you find the peace in you, people all around you will be benefited by your peaceful nature. Even if you don’t consciously do anything for them or say anything to them, you will be setting an example, and they will learn from your example. So that is a sort of selfless selfishness.'

	readingtitle: 'Every Morning You Have Two, Three Deities to Decorate',
	readingbody: 'Question: I believe in the teachings, and try to apply them, but I am not very regular in the formal practices. This causes me pain. Should I make more of an effort to do formal sadhana  or should I consider the pain to be a part of my spiritual practice? Sri Gurudev: Well, it is part of your sadhana. Almost all the devotees of God felt the pain of not doing enough to reach Him. That pain is a helpful thing. It reminds you of where you are. If you don’t feel bad about it, if you just say, “Okay, Swamiji said to take it easy, if I don’t meditate it doesn’t matter,” then you will not grow. When you are not doing the right thing, you should really feel pain. That will help you to change. At the same time, you should know your situation in life. If you are a wife and the mother of three children, you have certain family responsibilities also. If for that reason you cannot follow all the disciplines, getting up at a certain time and meditating for an hour and doing everything, you should not feel bad; but if you are not practising due to your laziness then you should feel hurt. If your responsibilities don’t allow you to do everything you are excused for that, because you still have your first and foremost responsibility as a wife and a mother. You have to take care of the children. That is also part of yoga. So you should ask yourself, “Am I not following everything due to my laziness, or due to my other responsibilities?” Then make the other responsibilities part of your practice also. For example, if you are all alone as an individual you may clean your altar and shrine room and decorate everything and sit and meditate. But as a mother every morning you have two, three deities to decorate. Pull them out of the bed, wash them, give them a nice bath, dress them well, feed them. That is the offering that you are giving to God. They are living gods in your home until you see them off to school. If you ignore them and go and sit and close your eyes and meditate, then God says, “What is this? You offer a piece of fruit on the altar, but I am here in your home in the form of your child and you ignore me.”'

	readingbody: 'If ever you lose money all of a sudden, know that it was ill-earned money. Well-earned money will never be robbed. I’ll give you a small illustration. Once upon a time in a village there lived a milkman who had a few cows. He used to milk them, and take the milk to the next village where he sold it to the restaurant owners. Slowly, slowly he became greedy and started adding water to the milk. Eventually, he doubled the quantity. If he got a gallon of milk, he added a gallon of water, and sold it as two gallons of milk. He did that for a long time. One day, on his way home, it started raining. He had to cross a river, but the river was in flood. So he tied all the money he had saved — a thousand dollars — into a bundle, and slowly started out across the river. When he was halfway across, he fell into the water. He was a good swimmer, however, and somehow swam to the other shore. As soon as he came out of the water, he checked his money; the bundle was there, but it was all disturbed. He wanted to make sure all the money was still there, so he started counting it. There was only five hundred dollars; he had lost five hundred. And he sat down and cried. A wise man came by and asked the milkman what was wrong; after hearing what had happened, he said, “Well, you are a milkman aren’t you?” “Yes, yes, I am.” “Don’t worry, you still have your milk money. The water money went with the water. The milk money came with you. Every time you cross the river, you pour a gallon of water into your milk. You took the water from the river, so the river took that five hundred dollars.” There is a village proverb, “Milk money is in the milk. Water money is in the water.” Remember that always. It’s not how much you earn, but how you earn it, that’s important. Your money should be very honest, clean money. Then you will always be benefited by it.'

What is your vision for the temple and the ashram? Sri Gurudev: My vision of LOTUS and Yogaville is a village filled with people who follow the yogic principles. Everything that is conducive to the yoga philosophy and lifestyle will be seen there. That’s my vision. In plain, simple language, my vision is for Yogaville to be a little heaven on earth. Every village should have a temple; first you build the temple, and then you live around it. So the LOTUS is a part of Yogaville. We are putting God in the centre, and building everything else around Him. LOTUS is religious yoga. Yogaville is practical yoga. The purpose of the LOTUS is to bring the religions together. The purpose of Yogaville is to bring people together. That’s why the LOTUS is part of Yogaville. In Yogaville we can live as a good community of yogis according to the yogic principles. The outside world may not know much about it, until and unless they come and see what is happening. But the LOTUS will draw outside attention also. It’s something unique and it will create an interest in us and our work. Here we are putting all the world religions under one roof. In that respect, it is unique. It should be the pride of Yogaville. Our goal is to make a beautiful Yogaville community and to prove to the world that as yogis we can live healthily, happily. We can live with all ease and with all peace, and be of good use.'

But this is only a beginning. I know that once people see the beauty and benefit of understanding among all religions, every town will want a LOTUS. I’m sure that will happen. It’s not just something for only a few people to experience; everyone should be able to participate. But somewhere, somebody has to begin. Probably God has chosen us as instruments to do that. So our aim is to educate people not to fight in the name of religion, but to experience their spiritual oneness. Let us know that we are all one in spirit; essentially, we are one appearing as many. The moment that kind of understanding comes, almost all other problems, both physical and material, will be solved. Until then they will never be solved. Anything that is done to bring this knowledge to people is the greatest deed. Any charity that’s used for this purpose is the best form of charity. I don’t deny the other charities; they are doing much great work. But if we work toward real universal love and understanding, we are going to the very root of the other problems. Achieving this should be first and foremost. Once we eliminate the cause of hunger, poverty, all the other problems, we will no longer have to worry about solving them. Do what you can for this cause; I’m not speaking just about the LOTUS, but about the cause of spiritual understanding. Learn to care and share, to love and give, and inspire others by your example. Spread these ideas. Then you are carrying a LOTUS with you in your heart.'

Are you lessening your worries? Do you always feel happy? If it bothers you more and more, then you are not doing it right. It’s not the action that is important, but how you do it. To decide whether you are doing the work in a spiritual way or not, ask yourself: “Am I maintaining my peace while doing this?” If the answer is “No,” then you are doing something wrong. Every job should make you happy, jubilant. You should enjoy it, whatever it is, and feel like doing more. You should forget yourself while you are doing it. Work should be fun, not a burden. If you become heavy while doing it, then you are doing it as a labour. Even if you look for a thank you, you are looking for some reward. When you do something for a reward, it’s labour.

You chose stars. You chose a time. Some of you might say, “No. My doctor chose the time,” but actually you made the doctor choose. Ultimately, it’s all your own doing. By changing your karma, you can change your horoscope. Maybe because of your past karma you have given room for some of the planets to control you. By developing a stronger karma, you can change that; you can make it null and void. Then Saturn cannot affect you; Jupiter and Mars cannot affect you. You can command them. Astrology is completely powerless in front of your karma. You have the capacity to command your stars to move around. A great saint used to say, “When I have the vision of the Lord always, what can these planets do to me? They have no power to affect me because I have taken refuge in the Lord.” Who controls the planets? Who controls time? Who controls space?

The minute you get married, the commitment chokes you. You immediately feel, “Ohh, it’s too much for me, I can’t live like this.” You want to get out. There is no commitment between husband and wife, between parents and child, between teacher and student, between employer and employee. Commitment is very important in life. Those who want to lead a spiritual life are here to change all these things and to rebuild a better world. Remember that. You have a great task, and it’s not impossible. If you really put your heart and soul into that, you can do it. Begin with your own life. Let nothing shake you. You have to be really bold and strong to achieve anything in life. Be that bold. When you know that something is right, don’t hesitate to follow it. Certainly there may be obstacles, tests; but don’t give up. Even if you should fall down or make a mistake, get up and say, “No!

Somebody called me, “Come, you do this.” Whatever came, I accepted. “Yes, maybe I have something to learn there.” Even going to different teachers was like that. It’s not that it was my wish. From the very beginning, there was some hand behind everything, guiding me from place to place. And that hand is still functioning. I am here today. I don’t know where I will be tomorrow.

Yes. Show business means it’s all just made up. It’s all superficial. And when you learn that lesson, then you can use that same philosophy in your life. The whole of life is show business. What am I doing here? I’m acting my part. What are you doing there? You’re acting your part. We’re having a show. There is no superior and inferior cast in this. We are all needed to make the show. You have taken a part, so play it well. We are all one in spirit, but I am playing the part of the teacher today. You are playing the part of being a little ignorant. Behave that way.

In the same way, prayer also is a sort of novocaine. When you pray you feel comforted, but you still have to go through the operation. So the operation has to be performed, but it is done under a sort of reduced pain. All our prayers and even the prayers and blessings from others, the good wishes and get well cards, all help us to rise above the pain: “So many people are praying for me. So many people are thinking of me. I’m getting the blessings of so many people, so I’ll get through it.” That feeling itself reduces the pain. Because after all what is pain? It’s in the mind. Pain is a sort of illusion. There’s no pain at all as such. Suppose you have an abscess in your tooth. It pains a lot. Even when you go to bed, you can’t sleep because it hurts so much. Then, when you really get tired, you slowly slip into sleep. Do you still feel the pain when you sleep? No. Does the abscess go away? No. The tooth is there, the abscess is there, yet you don’t feel the pain. The minute you are awake, then “Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!” The pain comes again. So where is the pain? If the pain is the tooth, the pain should continue until the tooth is healed. But, instead, when the mind forgets the tooth and the abscess, there’s no pain. When the mind thinks of it, the pain comes back. Is it not so? Do you know the treatment for a scorpion sting? The treatment is to put a drop of salt water in the eye. The sting in the eye is much greater than the sting in the hand, so the pain in the hand is forgotten and the mind is diverted to the pain in the eye. Of course, after a little while the tears flush out the eye, and that pain goes away. Because you have forgotten this pain due to that pain, and because that pain went away, you don’t go back to this pain. It is the same way with your prayers also. In a way, they nullify your pain.

	readingbody: 'Question: Everything comes from God, and thus everything is God. Therefore, how can it be said that there is a true Self and not true Self; or that, “I am not the body, not the mind.” It is like saying, “God is everything except the body, mind, etc.” Sri Gurudev: Very true. When you know that everything is God, and when you are experiencing everything as God, then you don’t even say, “I am not the body, I am not the mind.” The fellow who says, “I am not the body, not the mind,” is not experiencing everything as God. So there are different levels. When you are at the lower level you say, “This is Self and this is non-Self.” The duality comes. That’s how you begin. But as you go further and further, everything becomes the Self, including body and mind, right and wrong. There is no wrong then. Even the so-called “wrong” is also right. In one of his prayers the great sage Acharya Shankara praises God in this way. There is a Hindu form of worship called archana in which you offer flowers and repeat the name of God and His attributes. At one point he says, “O Lord, in the form of anger, my salutations to You. O Lord, in the form of lust, I am saluting You.” How could that be? One should not have lust. At the same time he is saying, “God, in the form of lust, my salutations to You.” It looks like a contradiction, does it not? It is not a contradiction if you put them all on the same level. On one level even lust becomes God. But at another level, when you don’t know how to use it, it becomes a terrible thing. When you don’t understand it, when you are looking at it in the wrong way, it becomes something undesirable. After all, there is only God. At a certain level you are able to see it from both sides. Then you see that they are one and the same. There’s no difference at all. At that point you say, “O lust, my salutations. O jealousy, my salutations, because you’re a quality of God. There’s nothing other than God. Without God, nothing is possible.” So it depends upon your level of growth. Both are correct at their levels. So we should not condemn any philosophy. People look at things from various sides. To them, it’s right. If you put yourself in their position, you will know they are right. Allow them to continue that way.'

So know that: “I am spirit originally, essentially, using the feminine body, so I am calling myself a woman.” That’s all. Because you have a little body, you call yourself a child. Because you have a wrinkled body, you call yourself old. So you are associating yourself with the body and mind. That is what creates all the problems. If we really want to know who we are, we must rise above all these things and say, “We are all spiritual beings. We are the image of God. We are all lights, burning, shining through different bulbs.” Some are good old 110 volt. There are also 108 volt. The minute you forget that, you revolt. So keep up the voltage.'

	readingtitle: 'Every Action has a Reaction',
	readingbody: 'Question: Do we incur bad karma each time we kill a bug or insect or frog while driving down the road? Sri Gurudev: Yes. Whatever we do, knowingly or unknowingly, brings karma. There’s no doubt about it. Even when you walk you might step on many insects. What should we do about that? The scriptures have given certain solutions. In our own life, as far as possible, we can offer our energy — material or physical, whatever it is — for the benefit of others to annihilate these bad karmas. It is called yagnya or sacrifice. There is a difference between the conscious karma and the unconscious or unavoidable karma. You have to pay for any karma done consciously, it is true; but you also have to do something in order to survive. You cannot escape from that. There is unavoidable karma. The only way out is to feel, “All right, having killed this many things while eating, breathing, driving, and walking, let me offer my energy for the benefit of the creation.” Pray; offer your service to others. That is yagnya. Yagnya means always offering back more than you receive. People can be categorised into five groups. The thief, the debtor, the fair businessman, the good person, and the saint. Who is a thief? The one who always gets things from everyone, but never gives anything. The debtor gets ten dollars worth but gives only five dollars worth to others. The fair businessman is the one who gets ten dollars worth of benefit from others and returns ten dollars worth. A good person gets ten dollars and gives at least twenty or thirty dollars — more than what he gets. And a saint doesn’t get anything; he just gives everything he can. So you can analyse your own life and see in which category you belong. The only way to wash out our bad karma is to be a really good person or a saint. That means through our service to the earth, to the people, to divine beings, to God. That way we can be pardoned for the karmas that we incur unconsciously.'

Unfortunately you cannot even see the enemy. Your enemy works through your eyes, through your nose, through your tongue, through every cell of your body. You are surrounded by the enemy. You need so much discipline to fight it. It’s a continuous battle until you really win over the senses. Of course when you win over your enemies, they are no longer enemies, they become friends. That’s the best victory. The real victory is not in killing the enemy, but in making him your friend.'

	readingbody: 'To a real spiritual seeker, God is the only buddy. All the other friends are equal. There is no, “She is close to me”, or “He is my best friend.” Spiritual seekers don’t form cliques. That’s all in the mind. A spiritual person should be above these discriminations. The closest friend is the One within. Your God, or your mantram. If you still want a closest friend in human form, then your teacher. Otherwise you are alone. You can have other associations, but watch for the result. Ask yourself, “Am I getting the benefit of becoming more rooted in my spiritual life? Is this association helping me, or is it shaking me? Is it creating more attachment and confusion?” We always have to think in those terms. “This is my path. I want to lead a detached life, a serviceful life. Not a personal life.” So your friendships should not be personal friendships. Your friendship is because he or she happened to be here and you are working together. Yes, friends. But not personal friends. A renunciate doesn’t have anything personal, because that person is already gone. The minute you put somebody or something as personal, attachment starts to come and that confuses the mind. So spiritual life is like that, not having anything as personal — whether you are a monk or a householder. A householder can also live like that; then he is a renunciate in the house, that’s all. There’s no personal relationship, but we are duty-bound. “My position is this, ‘Yes, I am the husband, I am the father of this house. I have a duty to perform to my wife, to my children, to take care of them. Other than that, I love everyone equally. Because I have some duty to the immediate family, I seem to be showing more love to them.’” But that doesn’t mean that you are not showing your love to others. It’s not your change of name or change of dress that makes you a renunciate. The lifestyle and mental attitude toward things and people makes you a renunciate.'

And that’s what you call God. Yes. Breathing itself is not in your hands. If you forget to breathe, God will make you breathe. Even if you don’t want to breathe, God will force you to breathe. Can you exhale and stop breathing? No. The air is forced back into the body. Who does that? Somebody is interested in your living. God is in you, working through your body and mind every minute.

If we see someone in trouble, should we just say, “That is some act!” or even worse, “That’s his karma?” Where do compassion and responsibility come in? Where does action come in? Sri Gurudev: If you feel that you are an actor, it cannot just be theoretical. You have to experience it. If you have that sincere feeling, then you are totally in the hands of God. God will tell you what to do with that “star,” whether to go and help him or ignore him. It’s not even your business then. You cannot say, “I have to be compassionate,” or “I have to ignore him. I have to decide that it’s his karma.” You are not deciding. Maybe that is his karma. God may not even present him to you. You may not even see him. If you really feel that God is working through you, and that you are an actor, that means you are not doing anything for yourself. You have been given a script; neither the words nor the actions are yours. You are asked to do certain things and you are just doing them, with total obedience. So let God decide what to do. He will tell you how to react. Otherwise it’s a little bit of God and a little bit of you. It’s not that easy to feel, “Oh, yes, I’m just an instrument in the hands of God.” We know the theory of it, and it is the truth, no doubt. We do nothing, nothing at all. That is plain fact. None of us is doing anything by himself or herself. It’s all being done by a Higher Will. It’s because of God’s energy, God’s consciousness working through you, that you seem to be doing a lot of things. There is a beautiful saying in the Koran: “Without the Will of God you cannot even tie your shoelace.”'

If you decide to do something and fail at achieving it, then that failure is also God’s decision. We don’t achieve all that we decide to attempt. That’s why we say, “Man proposes; God disposes.” Sometimes people seem to be achieving what they want. Probably those things are in agreement with God, and that is why those people are achieving them. But still, if a person thinks that he did something and he achieved it, then he is putting his ego there. So the individual should decide, “Am I planning out of my own ego, or are things just happening?” If you just allow them to happen, or if you feel, “God gave me the idea to plan this,” or if it gets fulfilled and you say, “It is His plan, He made use of me. Let Him be happy, let the glory go to Him,” then you don’t get very excited about it and you don’t look for the glory for yourself. When you don’t look for that, you don’t get disappointed. You just feel happy by having been a nice instrument in the hands of the Lord. That way is safer, because if it doesn’t happen as you planned, you don’t get disappointed. You just feel, “Probably that was God’s will.“'

That is what you are looking for, and that is what you see. When you sincerely look for God, He has to be present there and do His part. In this age, God is more kind and more merciful. He doesn’t demand much austerity. Even a little giving is enough. In those days when everything was beautiful, God demanded more. In this age, He knows that there are a lot of things to distract you. If you are going to think of Him even a little in the midst of all the distractions, that is a tremendous thing for Him. He will love you more. God does not look for quantity; He wants quality. Even if a little bit of sincere prayer is offered once from a devoted heart, that prayer will be answered. If your prayer is not answered, don’t blame God. Probably it did not come from a one hundred percent sincere heart. Be more sincere. Cry and weep. Probably you might feel ashamed or embarrassed if you do that in front of others. So shut your door. Then there is no one else there but you and God. You can be totally free from any shame. And God will answer your prayers. There is no doubt about it.

So if you don’t want to see fighting, you should learn to stay away from hating. What can you do when dogs fight? That’s their nature. We are not going to stop everything in nature. But if you can do something instead of hating the fighting, do it. Maybe the dogs are fighting over a piece of bread. Buy a number of pieces and throw them everywhere so that each dog will have one.

There is a beautiful saying in the Bhagavad Gita: “What is  will always be. What is not, never was and never will be.” The essence is always there. You can never destroy the essence. Then what is it that is destroyed? The form that the essence takes. Only the name and form are destroyed. Species keep changing. We cannot stop that. All of a sudden hundreds of whales die and get washed ashore. Can you stop that? It is all part of the nature. Peace is also a species on the verge of extinction. The whole world is now striving to save it. Let us do whatever we can to help others and to not consciously hurt anyone or anything.

Sri Gurudev: In the beginning, until we learn what His will is, we have to be dependent. Who is the One who wills, and who is the one who wants to know the will? Both are within you. Your own spirit, which is the image of God or the Cosmic Soul, acts according to the Cosmic Will. So if you are asking to know His will, you are asking your own conscience. In that case, your will is: Let Thy will be done, not my egoistic will. In other words, follow your conscience, not your ego. Ego is your will; the will of the conscience is His will.

Whatever you eat, eat it with the feeling that, “It is the spirit that has manifested as this food, and I am eating it.” “My body” means the body of the spirit. It is the spirit expressing the bread. So when you eat the bread you don’t eat something ordinary you eat the very spirit itself. Everything is God. God comes in the form of bread and you are eating it. So be thankful to God who has comes in the form of bread. And if that feeling is there, you don’t even have go to the church to have Communion. Even when you go and buy a piece of bread in the market, it becomes Communion if you eat it with that feeling. The whole world is the altar of God. Even when you eat something it is the God in you that is eating. You are offering it to God. If we only change our vision and the thought, whatever we do becomes spiritual practice. So, let our lives be a constant, constant service to God a huge altar here. The whole world is an altar. Everything is God’s manifestation. Whatever you do to somebody, you are doing to God.

When the curtain falls, there’s no swami and no audience. Ultimately all the chess pieces go into the same box. Before, there was no difference. After, there is no difference.

Every day when he sat to eat, along with a plate and glass, his wife placed a small bowl of water and a needle on the table. And every day when he finished the food, he would not have touched the needle or the bowl of water. Still, she used to put them there simply because he had asked her to. She never questioned it, because she respected him and knew he must have some good reason. She simply thought, “He asked me to do that and I am doing it. That’s all.” But the time came, after many years of married life, that Vaasuki was lying on her deathbed. Thiruvalluvar, seeing his wife’s sad face, questioned her, “Vaasuki, after all these years living with me and knowing the philosophy of life and death, why do you look like this? Are you afraid of dying?” She replied, “No. Having lived with you, I understand what death means. I am not afraid of dying, but still I have an unanswered question in my mind. You know, every day when you ate I put a bowl of water and a needle on the table. I never saw you use them. I’m just wondering what they were for.” Suppose I had spilled a grain of food,” he explained. “I could have just pricked it with the needle, washed it in the water, and put it back on the plate to eat.” If even one piece of rice had fallen, he would have taken it, washed it, and eaten it. That shows how respectful he was of food. There are two things to be noted here. Vaasuki had never during their whole married life questioned her husband’s request; and in all his life he had never spilled even one grain of rice.'

	readingbody: 'One of my very first teachers was Sadhu Swamigal of Palani in South India. I spent several years with him in the very beginning of my spiritual life. He was a great siddha (spiritually accomplished one), and he was a great tantric yogi. Pure tantric yoga means doing upasana of the deities. Upasana means sitting next to God. When you use yantras and mantras you are using tantras. It’s a sort of internal worship with total devotion. He was a great person and he had that kind of close communication with God. Very often at night we would hear him quietly talking to God, almost like a friend. His main deities were Lord Muruga and the bountiful Goddess, Mother Annapoorna. He did upasana of Annapoorna because he wanted to feed everyone. Even today, long after he left his body, his ashram still feeds thousands of people every day at Palani Hill. All the spiritual seekers and pilgrims around just go there and eat. We never knew where the provisions were going to come from, but they always came. Often rich people would come and give money to the ashram and say, “I want to feed two thousand people today in memory of my father,” or something like that. Of course the ashram had huge vessels and the people who contributed the money would themselves come and serve. But one day as we were about to retire, the person in charge of the provisions came and told myself and another swami, “The food’s all gone. We cannot even make gruel for tomorrow. There’s not even a single grain of rice. We don’t know what to do.” Swamiji was sitting there on the veranda talking to some people. We went there, wringing our hands. “What is the matter?” he asked. “Swamiji, there is a crisis.” “Hah! What is the crisis?” “There’s not even a single grain of rice for tomorrow.” He laughed and laughed, “Oh, I see. Terrific. What are you going to do?” “We don’t know.” “I see. Well, who has been feeding you all these days?” “Muruga. Annapoorna.” “If you deserve it, you will be fed again tomorrow. Don’t worry. Go to sleep.” That’s all he said, “If you deserve it, you will get your food. Go.” And we simply had to go and retire. At 12 o’clock midnight, a farmer from the next village came and knocked at the door. When we opened it, we saw two cartloads of rice bags. The farmer said, “I was just falling asleep when I had a dream. A beautiful lady dressed all in white appeared to me and said, ‘Get up and take some rice to Sadhu Swamigal ashram. Go right away. They need rice for tomorrow.’ I didn’t have the courage to question her. I simply put the rice in the carts and brought it here at once.” Imagine how we felt. Many times it happened, many times. We should have that kind of total trust in God. We should know that if God is going to provide for us, He will provide. We don’t have to worry about it. '

But I still need Your help. I need Your strength. I don’t have that much strength of my own.” So, have that faith, and do it with sincere prayer. It is better to try than to be afraid. If, out of fear, you don’t try it, how do you know whether you can do it or not? Sometimes when you try, you may do it and find your fear was just a waste. So there’s no need to be afraid. Fear is not going to help us. Simply do it boldly, and God will help you. Remember God helps those who help themselves. If you have that kind of faith, there’s no need to be afraid. Fear and faith don’t go together. You say you have faith in God; God has all the strength, all the capacity, He’s omnipresent, omnipotent, If you have that deep faith in a powerful God and if at the same time you say, “Oh, am afraid of this, afraid of that,” then you don’t really believe in God. If you believe in God, you will think, “God will take care of me. I’m doing what I can.” Even if something happens so that you don’t get what you want, you don’t need to be afraid. Your faith will say, “Well, maybe God didn’t want me to have that.” You accept it. “I wanted it. Yes. And I tried hard, but I didn’t get it. Why? Because God didn’t want me to have it. So I accept it.” If you have faith, you can move mountains. The problem is you cannot develop that kind of faith unless the mind is clean. You need a steady and pure mind, an undisturbed mind, that’s not distracted by all kinds of worldly desires. A mind that’s not contaminated by, “I, me, mine.” Only in a pure mind can you develop that faith. If you have that faith you can achieve everything. Blessed are the pure in heart, they shall see God. That’s the duty of every sincere seeker after truth — truth being permanent peace, permanent joy; experiencing God in the form of peace and joy within. There’s no shortcut.'

And it’s all for good.” You are an instrument in the hands of the Super Consciousness; it functions through you as an individual consciousness. You are a little cell, and that Cosmic Consciousness makes you function. You don’t do anything, so why worry about anything? All you have to do is know, “Yes, God is working through me. Credit or demerit goes to Him. I am not responsible. I am simply an instrument. God, I know you are the one who is using me.” If your life is like that, if you fully realise this truth, where is the difficulty for you? You are not even giving yourself into the hands of God. Who are you to even give? Simply know that you are already in the hands of God. Would you have any burden in life after such a realisation? No. How peaceful you would be, how happy you would be. So, that’s my prayer, “God, let me always remember that it is You and You alone working through this instrument. Whatever comes should go to You. It’s not mine. People may praise me. Fine, the praise is Yours. By putting a garland around my neck, they are really honoring You. They may kick me out; it’s You they are kicking. You are the one doing the kicking too. Having created me, You get the kick out of it. Why should I worry about it?” I tell you, that’s the simplest way. You can be totally, totally free from any problem in life. I’m positive about that.'

	readingbody: 'When you know why you are living and why you are working, that will give you strength. If you enjoy living, you enjoy working; the joy itself is enough to put a lot of strength in you. If you don’t enjoy living and working, life becomes a burden to you and weakens you. People who don’t enjoy their activities get tired very soon. If you really enjoy what you are doing, you will never get tired. Feeling tired is mainly in the mind. When you don’t like something, it becomes very heavy to you. You carry it as a burden. Suppose you are asked to carry a big rock. You might say, “Ohh, it’s too much, I can’t carry it.” But suppose I give you a big bundle of gold coins even heavier than that rock? Somehow you will find the strength to drag it. That shows that burdens are simply rocks in the mind.'

	readingbody: 'When others criticise you, there are two things to think of. First, “That’s the way they look at me and that’s what they see.” Give them that freedom. Probably they may not see the other, better side. Feel sorry for them. Leave it at that. The other thing to think about is, “Yes, he is like a mirror. Through him I see my defects.” You go in front of a mirror to clean the dirty spots from your face. In the same way, this person is revealing your dirty spots. Thank the person and work on it. Then you will even look for criticism, because you can get help from that. If people don’t criticise you, you will never know your own defects. If you see it in this light, you will never be angered by that. But if the mirror continues to show your dirty spot and you become defensive and punch it, you lose your mirror, you lose your fist, and you still have the dirty spot.'

	readingbody: 'By putting out positive thoughts, and correcting your mistakes, you can heal your problems. But don’t do something to alleviate the problem without correcting the cause. The suffering came for your benefit. You should not try to take that away. Instead, bring out the nice things, the good qualities in you , the positive side in you, and the negative will get cured itself. Self-healing should be that way. If you have some problem, ask yourself, “How did I get into this? What is the cause?” Then make a resolution: “Yes, in the future I will not encourage such thoughts. I will cultivate the opposite.” The best way to drive away the darkness is to bring light into the room.'

	readingbody: 'Sometimes we somehow get frightened, and a fear gets into the subconscious mind. Consciously din into the mind that you are immortal and that there is nothing to be afraid of. Think in a positive way. Boldly meditate on it. Convince your conscious mind, and let the conviction sink into the subconscious mind. You can even make a tape of your own, put it under your pillow, and literally sleep on it. It will slowly sink into your subconscious mind. The fear has gone into the subconscious, and you need to replace it with positive thoughts. So until the new ideas sink in, keep listening to them. Your mind is not completely sleeping, and your subconscious mind will still be listening to the tapes. When you are awake, consciously think of it, write down a reminder that you can read now and then. Put reminders everywhere until it’s completely rooted out. Do all the positive things you can think of. There are other ways also. But the yogic way is to put a new, opposite thought into the mind so that the undesirable thought will be squeezed out. And if you can’t do it all by yourself, get help from others.'

The main goal behind all these searches and approaches and actions is to realise our true nature, to realise the Self, the God within, and thus to realise that everything is the expression of that same Spirit. Until and unless that happens in life, we will have to he born again and again. We will have to die many times. That is the one and only goal behind our existence. It doesn’t matter what you do, your goal should be to come close to this understanding: “Essentially I am God’s spirit, I am the pure Self. I am Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.” Ascertain your true nature, your spiritual nature. You are only functioning through this body and mind. They are your vehicles. You are not the body.

How much discipline is needed to send a man to the moon? How much is necessary even to make an Olympic champion? The athletes are not allowed to smoke. They have dietary restrictions; they have a curfew. They have to practice regularly. And it’s all for a small piece of gold. How much discipline is necessary to climb an ordinary mountain? And how much more discipline is required to climb Mount Everest? Here we are trying to climb the highest mountain: Ever Rest. All the great sages and saints said, “Discipline is necessary. Discipline your life. Control your senses.” They were not fools. We need places where we can learn discipline in life. It is in harnessing our energies that we get more benefit. Take hydroelectric energy, for example. Where do you get it? How do you get it? A free-flowing river is harnessed by a dam. Then the water is channeled through a big pipe. It runs through a turbine. And when the electricity is generated, it is stepped down by smaller transformers until it reaches your home. It is all discipline. If even one wire were exposed in your house, it would give you a shock or start a fire. When you have a pet, and if you say, “Sit,” and it sits, you are so happy, so proud. How many owners of pets show off how disciplined their pets are? What do you see in the circus? All the lions, tigers, elephants, and horses are disciplined. So don’t ever forget that any achievement in life is based on discipline.'

It is very fortunate to even live in an age in which there are such great souls. The scriptures say, “The greatest bliss, the highest joy, embodiment of wisdom absolute, non-dual, boundless like the sky, He is the goal of ‘Thou art That.’ One, eternal, pure, and still, witness of the whole universe, beyond mind’s grasp, of gunas free, to that guru may my worship be.” That means, the one who has all these qualities personified, he is the true guru. To him I give my salutations. Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj is an embodiment of all these qualities. I feel very fortunate in having had him as my teacher, and to have seen his example even while he was functioning in the physical frame. If you see any little bit of truth or knowledge in me, it is the spark that came from that great Light. Being a small spark myself, it is almost impossible for me to fathom or talk about him. But let us take this occasion to remember a little bit of the real qualifications of a teacher; and at the same time to realise how lucky we are to have this association and how careful we should be in not missing this opportunity to realise that Light within. Life is limited; death can come at any moment. So, make hay while the sun shines. God bless you.'

It is still more difficult to have a sane mind in a sound body. We must understand that well. It’s not just an accident that we are in this beautiful, human frame. Certainly we have done millions and millions of meritorious deeds to qualify ourselves for this. A human birth is the only birth in which we can get liberated from the ocean of samsara or the constant ups and downs of life. This is our chance. This is the earning and learning place. That is why a human birth is a rare, rare privilege given to us. But that is only one of the three greatest blessings. Even though you may have these things, the scriptures say to have a thirst to know the truth is even more rare. We see millions of people with a sound body and sane mind who have a thirst to accumulate a little money, name, fame. Name comes and goes. Money comes and goes. Even beauty comes and goes. A few wrinkles make us look old. So what is permanent? Only those things that are permanent are truth. The quest for the permanent, for the truth, is very rare. Even if you have a human birth and the thirst to know the truth, there is something that is still more rare. To have someone to tell you where the truth is. A spiritual guide. There are many teachers who can help you to earn a little money, who can help you to beautify yourself or to get a little knowledge, but the ultimate truth is to be shown only by someone who has experienced the truth with the help of another person who got the truth. This truth passes from person to person. Spiritual teachers are very rare; and if you are lucky enough to find one you should realise how fortunate you are. That’s how I felt when I met my Master. We are really fortunate to have such guidance and to remember his teachings and his greatness, how he shed light to millions of people without even leaving the Himalayas.'

Is it permanent or changing?” Every minute you should discriminate, “Will this disturb my peace, or help me to retain it?” If anything comes to you, your first and foremost question should be, “Is this going to disturb my peace?” If so, then don’t accept it. You don’t avoid such things to get more peace. Nothing can add more peace. Things can either disturb your peace or just be there without disturbing your peace. That’s all. Either this or that. If something is going to disturb your peace, you should question, “Why should this disturb my peace? It’s not disturbing the other person’s peace. Is there anything wrong with the thing or with me?” Then you realise, “Yes, the mistake is with me. The thing by itself is not going to disturb me.” You can have all the wealth in the world and still not get disturbed by anything. On the other hand, you can renounce everything except one tiny little item and lose your peace over that one thing.'

In moments of tranquility, must we always keep one eye watching for the enemy to come over the hill? Sri Gurudev: Yes, it is better to watch for it. Life is always like that. It is in that quietness that the enemy comes to test how peaceful you are. If darkness comes, look for the light that follows. When the day comes, watch for the night that follows. If you know that one will not be there without the other, then you won’t get caught in either. Absence of turmoil is not real peace. Real peace is when you rise above the turmoil, and stay peaceful in the midst of it.'

If we want to stay afloat, we have lighten the load in the boat.” Immediately the man said, “Oh, don’t worry; I can take care of it.” He had a heavy basket in the bottom of the boat, so he picked it up and put it on his head. “Is it okay now?” It was a heavy basket, so he thought, “I will just carry the basket and reduce the weight in the boat.” Whenever you say, “I did it,” you are carrying your basket while sitting in the boat. The truth is, no matter where the basket is, all of the weight is being carried by the boat. Whether you keep it in the bottom of the boat or on your head is immaterial. As long as you feel that you are carrying it, you are responsible, you are doing something, fine, then carry it. The Lord just smiles: “All right, let him carry it.” But if you decide to put the weight on His shoulder, He is ready and willing to carry it. The freedom is there. You can either keep the basket in the boat, or on your head. Sensible people will keep it in the boat; egoistic people will keep it on their head, that’s all.

So you can just tell the person, “I feel that you should be a little more careful.” There’s nothing wrong in advising someone that way. Even if the dream is a false dream, he or she doesn’t lose anything by being a little more careful. You are not hurting anyone. If the dream is about you and there is something that you can do to be more careful, do it. If the dream doesn’t make any sense, just drop it. Not all dreams are absolute truth. Some are meaningless. The mind functions on various levels. So don’t worry too much about it. You yourself will know clearly, “Yes, these are some of the dreams that I should pay attention to. I should be more careful.” If you don’t find any sense to some of the dreams, ignore them. If God wants to speak to you through a dream, He will give some clarity also. God will not tell you something without enabling you to understand it. If you don’t really understand, you could say: “God, I don’t know why the dream came. If it is the one that You sent me, I don’t seem to understand. Maybe tomorrow night you can clarify it.” Otherwise just drop it. Anything that you don’t clearly understand, just ignore; because a dream need not always be true. That’s why it’s called a dream.'

If you are prompted to change, then change it. Even that will be prompted. Something will tell you, “Come on, go ahead and try to change it.” Then your answer should be, “Okay, God, if that’s what You want, let me do it with Your backing. You are prompting me, so I am doing it.” It’s super surrender, and life is really beautiful that way. All you have to do is follow His lead. The brush never tells you, “Oh, touch here, touch there, use a broader stroke.” You simply be the brush, and let Him paint whatever He wants.

But if you worship God in the walking temples, it will also reach Him in the stationary one.” We are all walking temples. Your body is your temple. The Lord is inside you. Your heart is His altar. That means service to humanity is worship of God. If you worship God only in the church or synagogue, humanity is not going to be benefited. God does not need your service for Himself. He doesn’t need a temple. There is God in everyone, If you give someone some food, you are offering it to the God residing in him or her. If you repair a vehicle, you are repairing it so that God can drive around. The real reward in doing things is seeing how many others will be benefited by them.'

	readingbody: 'Question: How does a master love his disciples? How did you as a disciple learn to love? Sri Gurudev: “How does a master love his devotees?” You will certainly know it when you become the master. A true master loves not only his or her devotees, but loves everybody and everything equally. There are no gradations; his love for everybody is the same. Sometimes it might appear to be a little more for the disciples just because they are nearby and they are following the teachings. It might look as if he loves them more. Sometimes he might even say, “I love you more than anybody.” Probably that is one way of encouraging you. It need not be true. Don’t get carried away by that. Just to encourage and inspire you, he could say “Oh, you are the most beloved devotee.” It’s for your benefit. But to him everyone is the same because his love is unconditional. Whether you follow the teachings or not, whether you praise him or blame him. You might go and backbite. You might even renounce him or denounce him. It doesn’t matter; you are still the same to him. Pure love doesn’t look for any return. And that is true love. Everyone should learn to love that way. The question now is, “How did you as a disciple learn to love?” There again, I don’t think I ever learned to love. It’s not something that you learn. It’s spontaneous. It just comes from the heart. Nobody needs to teach you. When you see something beautiful, something greater than you, and you feel that you are receiving a lot, what can you return? You cannot return all that you get from a teacher and probably the teacher doesn’t need any return. He doesn’t even expect your love. But from your side, you can return that just by loving. By loving that person, you love the teaching. You love everything that you get from the person. Because you love it, you cherish it and use it in your life. It’s not that you just love the teaching and put it aside. You apply it in your very life. That’s the only way you can express your genuine love to the teacher. The teacher doesn’t look for anything else.'

Until that is over, I will keep him there. Once the job is over, I will fire him.” In a way we are all hired by a higher authority. And we have to do our part. Once the job is over, you will be called in. God is a great economist also. He will not waste even an ounce of extra breath on you. Yes. It’s all measured; He sent you packaged with a certain amount of breath. So it’s not our job. This is a cosmic mission. We are all doing our part. Let us do it consciously. “It’s all God’s work. God has sent me to do something. God has given me all the necessary things to fulfill my job, to perform my duty; and He is behind me making me do things also. I don’t have to worry about anything.” We unnecessarily take many a responsibility upon our shoulders: “I have to do this. I’m responsible for it.” No. None of us is responsible for anything. If we have any responsibility, it is to know the Truth. Let us know the Truth. “My responsibility is to know who sent me and for what purpose, and to allow that unseen hand to function through me.” Don’t put up impediments.

Sincerity in seeking comes only when you know that you have a limited capacity. Then you link yourself with an unlimited capacity. Asking for help also is like that. Only when you say, “I can’t do it anymore, please help me,” does the help come. Sometimes God seems to be a hard-hearted person. He waits until you really, really give up. Until then, your prayers are not really sincere. They may be beautiful. You may sing nice songs. You may have a good voice. Your chants may be wonderful, your Indian chants or Gregorian chants. But when you cry, you don’t worry about your voice, about the tune, about a pitch. It’s simply, “Ohhh, my God, please!” You shout it. Yes. And that is what you call sincere prayer. It should come from the very heart, not from the head. That prayer is heard immediately. So let us become that kind of seeker. Let’s be sincere and serious. We should be totally convinced that, “I am nothing. My capacities are very limited.

Even the terrible sinner has a place. We have no right to condemn anyone. But we can set good examples for others to follow. The world is full of ups and downs, positive and negative. It’s like a big factory. Human beings come in as raw material, and they are in the process of becoming perfect. Look at a Detroit car factory. At one end you see the beautiful finished cars, ready to be shipped out, but what do you see at the other end? All crude, raw materials. Metal sheets, nuts and bolts, that go through processing. A lot of cutting, chipping, rubbing, scrubbing, chiseling, filing, grinding, welding, pressing. Slowly, it takes shape. People are like that also. That’s what you call evolution or growth. Through that we gain experience, we learn. Even a sinner is there to show you what is not to be done. That person is an example for you. By seeing him, you realise, “Oh, I shouldn’t do that.” So, it’s really not possible to find the world one hundred percent peaceful at any given moment.

Sri Gurudev: Gurudev sighs and leans back in his chair with his eyes closed. For a moment he is lost in reverie, with a radiant expression on his face. There is no way to describe that experience. It’s almost like saying, yes, you worked hard, you accomplished a lot, came home, had a nice shower, went into the kitchen and had some supper, then came to your bedroom, turned on some soft music, had a warm drink, turned down the lights and then prepared the bed, lay down, covered yourself with a blanket, closed your eyes, repeated your mantra and then… What would you say the next morning if someone asks you, “What did you experience? Tell me?” You cannot put into words what you experience. We can use our limited ability and say, “A great relief, a peace and ease. As if all your burdens have been taken away and you are simply floating.” What you experience at the end of the pilgrimage is really very hard to explain, but the entire journey prepares you for it. Every minute you experience God’s hand at work. Every minute. Several times I almost said goodbye; but by His grace, I came back again. So, all of these things in a way prepare us by showing us that without His help we cannot do anything. Nothing that we own, nothing that we call ours will help us to experience God within and without. You might have a strong body; but when there is no oxygen, what are you going to do? You may have millions of dollars, but there is nothing to buy. So everything becomes nothing. In a way, you are made to learn the worthlessness of everything that you have depended upon. It is at that point that you say, “It’s only God’s grace that helps me.” Truly, God is everywhere. It’s not that God can be seen only in that spot. But because you paid such a big price, you can more easily recognise Him there. So pilgrimages prepare you for that experience. You literally live with God. Life is also a pilgrimage, to prepare us for that experience of realising that God is everywhere, within and without.'

Wherever you go, there will be a classroom. There will be a teacher waiting to teach you. You have to learn it today or tomorrow or next year or in the next life or after ten lives. That means after ten bodies. Until we learn the Truth, we will be given body after body after body. So how can you say it is too late? It’s never too late. At the same time, know that it doesn’t really take that much time to save yourself, or to know God, or to know the Truth. If your life is filled with dedication and renunciation, there’s nothing to colour or cover your vision. And when your vision becomes clear, you immediately experience the Truth.'

	readingbody: 'Question: I understand that we are not to hate Hitler. But are we to love him? Sri Gurudev: Certainly. He is also a child of God. The same God whom you love created him too. He was a naughty brother, that’s all. He was also your own brother. He came into the same family. If your own brother became violent, what would you do? Would you hate him? You would love him, but you would correct him. You would stop him from doing the wrong things, but you would not hate him. By hating such people what do you gain? You are hating yourself then. Hating is not the answer. It doesn’t take you anywhere. If you still want to hate someone, hate the one who created you and him. Yes. That’s what I tell those people who really want to hate Hitler. It’s your own God whom you love, who you say is all merciful, that created him. Why should that God create such a fellow? It’s the mistake of God then. Hate Him. Destroy all His places. Don’t build any temples for Him, synagogues for Him. But if you love your God, then accept that God probably created a boy like that purposely, probably to teach us a lesson. By hating, we don’t accomplish anything.'

	readingtitle: 'Self-Healing Is Possible',
	readingbody: 'We should know that the breath — the prana, or life force — and the mind are intertwined. Wherever one goes, the other follows. When the mind becomes agitated, the breath becomes agitated. When the mind is totally peaceful, the breath almost comes to a stop. So in the same way you can direct the prana with your thoughts. For example, if you look at your thumb and think, “I am going to make the thumb warm,” think “warm,” and not “hot,” or you might get a blister. Yes. If your thinking is very concentrated and you are totally one-pointed as you send your thoughts to the thumb, all of the prana and blood will rush there, and you will get heat. In that way, you can send the vital energy wherever you want. The same principle applies to healing also. By sending your thoughts to any affected part, you send your prana. Self-healing is possible. In a way, even when you pray for healing that’s what you are doing. You trust that the higher power, God, is helping you to heal that. And you believe it, is it not so? So you are communicating with the higher power, and that energy automatically goes to the affected part along with your little energy.'

	readingbody: 'Only a very few are born with courage. Most people are weak; it takes a long time for them to build up courage. It takes real courage to understand the truth. Real courage means to give up “I, me, mine.” It’s not courageous to gather things. What we normally call courage is getting Gold Medals, Bronze Medals, fighting, winning, gaining. A “courageous” person jumps from a plane with a parachute three thousand feet up in the air. But the real courage is to give up everything and say, “I own nothing.” Very few are courageous enough to renounce everything in the name of God, in the name of service to humanity. You might call somebody courageous who comes and gives a nice punch to a person and all the person’s teeth fall out. But if the fellow who got the hit smiles at him, “Is that all you are capable of?” It doesn’t matter, don’t worry. Maybe you haven’t learned the lesson yet. I forgive you, who is courageous then? The one who hit, or the one who smiled and lovingly forgave him? It takes more courage to forgive someone. And much more courage to forget. Even after forgiving, you might still remember. But to forget takes a lot of courage, a lot of training of the mind.'

	readingbody: 'Bondage and liberation are within you. You bind yourself and you have to liberate yourself. If you don’t want to part with something and depend on that for your happiness, then you are not independent. What is independence? Not to depend on anything, at any time. A few centuries ago a chief minister of a country suddenly got into a spirit of renunciation and said, “I don’t want to possess anything anymore. I just want to be free.” So he renounced his job and his house and said, “The sky is my roof, the whole world is my house, and God is my Father.” Then he went and sat in front of a temple. He had been a very nice, capable chief minister. When he suddenly left everything, the king became upset and sent a messenger asking the minister to come back. But the minister said, “No, I am no longer interested in that job.” Then the king decided to go see the minister himself. He found where the minister was sitting and stood in front of him, “Swami?” “Yes?” “Do you recognise me?” “Yes, I recognise you.” “Please tell me what it is that you have gained by leaving everything to sit here like this.” The minister looked at the king and said, “Until yesterday I was standing and you were sitting. Today I am sitting and you are standing. That is the first gain.” That is the greatness of renouncing your selfish life. You will not be afraid of anyone. If you’re honest, you will be fearless. And when you’re fearless, you’re powerful. Ego will never make you powerful. You may appear to be powerful, but you are not truly powerful. The most egoistic people are the most fearful people, because they are constantly afraid of getting their ego hurt. They want to get everything they want, and if something is denied, immediately they get hurt. But a selfless person who is honest and has a clear mind, who is a righteous person, is always powerful. He doesn’t need to worry about anybody.'

	readingbody: 'Human birth is a great opportunity for us. According to the Hindu and Buddhist philosophies, which believe in reincarnation, you have been passing through hundreds and thousands of births. Now you have been given this human birth, where you have a little freedom to think, to find out the ways and means to get out of the continuous cycle. This is the opportunity. If you are going to miss this, you don’t know when you will have another chance. You might get caught in the whirlpool again. So don’t waste this life. Human life is not just to satisfy the senses. We have done that before in many other births. Even an animal eats, sleeps, begets children. They marry, even without the help of a priest or rabbi. What are you doing beyond that? You may earn a lot of money and build skyscrapers; haven’t you seen birds building beautiful hanging palaces? They swing in the air. Can you build a nest like that? Can you build an anthill? How many special separate apartments are there in the anthill? Who is the architect, who is the engineer? Where did they study? In your colleges and universities? We are so proud, but the animals just laugh at us. In what way are we superior then? Not by building houses and comfortable vehicles or begetting more children or making ourselves beautiful. You can never make yourself more beautiful than a peacock, however much you rub, scrub and put on makeup. A butterfly is a thousand times more beautiful than you and I. What is it that we want then? The only thing that differentiates man from the other animals is the urge to get out of this vicious cycle, to know our true nature. That is our first and foremost duty. If we miss this opportunity, no one knows when we are going to get it again. Get out of this whirlpool while there is still time and energy. Become great servants of humanity. Renounce all the selfish shells. Be liberated. Walk on the earth like liberated gods, representations of God, the true children of God. Shed the light of God wherever you go. Let people see the light in you and see their light with the help of your light.'

	readingbody: 'Selfish thoughts disturb the mind. When the mind is disturbed, the body gets disturbed. This is how some accidents occur. That is why the condition of the mind is very important. If the mind is serene and peaceful, many accidents could be avoided. By keeping your mind calm, you can win over your karma. If you change your mind you can annihilate your karma. It is not necessary for the karma to bind you. If you have peace of mind, even if karma comes you may not know it. It will just come. There is a South Indian saying, “What came for your head, took away your hat.” The karma came to take your head, but because of your peace of mind and presence of mind, it just took your hat away. That was enough to nullify the karma. Even if the karma is really going to affect you, let it affect you. But remain peaceful. Stay calm. Don’t give room for thoughts such as, “Ohh, karma is more powerful, somehow it is going to affect me terribly!” Then you are already affected. Even the very thought, “No, I think it will never leave me alone,” invites the karma to come and then it will come. Just stay calm, cool and live in the golden present.'

That is why your face changes when your mind is happy. It glows. People do not see your mind, but they see your face. When your mind is unhappy, don’t they say, “Hey, what’s wrong?” Why? Because the face expresses the mind. Every cell will listen to the mind and get changed according to its moods. That is why when you are in a very depressed state, you cannot even get up or do anything. You say, “Ohh, I can’t do a thing today. I’m so upset.” Getting upset is in the mind. The body should be able to get up and jump and play games, but it cannot because the body and mind are interconnected. If one falls sick, the other will also fall sick.

His name was fitting: Ramdas, the servant of Ram. He saw Ram in every face. Somebody once said to him, “Why don’t you go to Benares?” “Ahh, Okay. Maybe Ram told me. Alright. Well, how should I go?” “Go to the railway station and take the train.” He went to the railway station, and when the train came, he got on. The ticket collector said, “Where is your ticket?” “Oh, Ram didn’t tell me about that.” “Well, you can’t continue.” “Okay, what do you want me to do?” “You have to get off at the next station.” “Fine.” He got off at the next station, “Because Ram asked me to get out, I got out; that’s all.” So he just sat there on the platform until somebody came and said, “Why are you sitting here?” “Ram wanted me to sit here.” “How did you come here?” “Oh, Ram said I should go to Benares on the train, and again Ram came and asked me to get off.” “Oh, that’s not right. You are simply listening to every Tom, Dick and Harry.” “No, it’s Ram. Ram as Dick. Ram as Harry. The same Ram.” “So who am I?” “You are also Ram.” “Okay, all right, stand up.” “Okay.” “Sit down.” He sat. “Stand up.” That fellow made him stand up and sit down fifteen times. Still, he felt, “Ram said so; alright, I’ll do it.” Finally the fellow realised the greatness of this person; he felt terrible and fell at Ramdas’ feet saying, “I’m so sorry.” “Oh, Ram, you shouldn’t do that.” “Come on, come on, the next train is bound for Benares, you get on.” “Alright.” It didn’t matter who said what; to him it all came from Ram.'

If it is my want, it will never get fulfilled. So I leave it to You. You give me whatever You need for Your service. The minute You think that I have finished with that tool and I don’t need it anymore, take it away.” It all boils down to this one thing: faith in a higher power. An unseen hand that constantly molds. “You put me here, I am here. You gave me this job, I am doing it.” There’s no superiority, inferiority. No “How come he is doing that, while I am doing this?” No. God selects each one for His work, and He gives various jobs to various people. Everything is equally great. There is nothing superior or inferior. Do every job joyfully as God’s work. In the process of working, if your mind goes through some turmoil, suspicion or doubt, it will get cleared up when you meditate. All the problems that you created in your doing are undone by meditating. That’s why meditation is so important.'

	readingbody: 'Through sound you can create anything. There is no limit. The whole universe was created with sound. That is the power of the mantram. But unfortunately many who have a mantram do not even seem to realise its power. If you do not have faith in it, even though it is powerful, you will not experience it. When you do not have faith, naturally you will not repeat it much. Whether you have faith in it or not, if you put your finger in the fire it will burn. But you have to put your finger in the fire to get the experience. Whether you believe in the mantram or not, repeat it. Then you will know what it can do. The smaller the mantram, the bigger the power. Anything that is atomised gets more power. The more powerful mantras will take a little longer time to bring the benefit. But of course your faith will enhance it; it gets a little more charged with a little love. The other way is very dry, but still, if you keep repeating it the faith will come. It will come whether you want it to or not. You do not need to have a lot of mantras for different purposes. No. Sometimes, when you say, “Oh, he is starting a journey, let us repeat a special mantram for his safety,” I laugh at it, but I say, “All right, let them do it.” Why a special mantram all of a sudden? What happened to your own mantram? Can’t your personal mantram take care of that journey? It will take care of everything. The personal mantram is enough; but sometimes our faith in our own mantram is limited. We think that unless we repeat something especially for that purpose, it won’t be useful. So for that sake, all right, go ahead, do it. But if you have complete faith, one mantram is enough for everything. It will take care of all of your trips, your problems, your diseases — or even someone else’s. That is why you do not need to have so many things; just have faith, faith, faith.'

If I need some companion, You will give me that companion. If I need some money to do my service to You, You will send me the money.” The mere fact that you are not getting something means that God thinks you don’t need it. How nice life would be if we could just remember this. If you don’t get it, think, “God probably thinks I don’t need it. If I need it, even if I say, ‘No, I don’t want it,’ He will force it into my hand.” There is a beautiful South Indian proverb, “For the one who weaves, there’s no need for a monkey.” When you use a hand-weaving machine, you work with delicate, thin yarns. And if you have a monkey for a pet, you are not going to weave much of anything. Because, as you know, monkeys like to imitate everything. So that means if you are interested in weaving, you shouldn’t keep a monkey as a pet. If God created you for weaving, He won’t give you a monkey even if you want it. If He decides to give you a monkey, He will train the monkey to help you in weaving. Maybe to push the shuttle. We should have that kind of faith. That kind of acceptance won’t come unless you have tremendous faith in God. Tremendous faith in a higher force, in the consciousness that sent you here, and that functions through you.'

A certain thing will happen only if God’s Will okays it. Otherwise it won’t. We should trust completely. If we have trust, then even if others do or say something to us, we need not have any negative feeling about them. We need not even think that they are being negative to us. They cannot be negative to us without God’s Will. Why should our good God allow one person to have negative feelings against another? If that is happening, there must be some reason for it. We should not even call it a negative feeling. It is a positive feeling that seems to be hurting me, and so I call it negative. If others cause us difficulty, we call them negative people; but nobody can cause us difficulty without God’s Will. That means in some way or another we deserve to face such people; so those people are simply acting as instruments of God. God uses some people to give us an experience. It’s all for our education. Rewarding and punishing both come from God, and are for our benefit. If we think that way, we won’t be projecting negative vibrations toward the people who we think are negative to us. See? Even by thinking that they are negative, you are projecting a negative image. It’s hard for you to love the people who project a negative image toward you, because you feel they are negative. The minute you say, “She is negative to me, but I am going to love her anyway,” you are trying to force yourself to love that person. Instead, if you treat her as an instrument of God feel, “God is doing something to me through that individual, but she is a beautiful person,” then there is no negative feeling and no negative person.

Pleasure and pain are also two sides of the same coin. If you only want pleasure and hate pain, you become miserable. After one, the other is certain to follow. When it comes and you don’t want it, you fight it. Instead, we must recognise that life is like that. If someone is nice to you and you demand that he or she must always be nice to you, always respect you, then you are seeing only one side. If the other side comes, you deny the person, you hate the person. You should know that the other side will also be there. Love that person for the other side also.

	readingbody: 'Question: We have been very busy lately and we haven’t been able to meditate or do pujas anymore. Even while at school or while playing we seem to forget about God. What can we do to bring God back into our lives? Sri Gurudev: The easiest way is to know that whatever you do is worship. Anything that you do anywhere, even if you wash dishes to help your mama, it’s a puja. Puja doesn’t mean only sitting in front of an altar and doing something. The kitchen is an altar, the house is a temple, and God is in you. When you go to sleep, you are putting God to sleep. When you walk around, you are taking God in a procession. So we have to get into the habit of thinking that way. Whatever you do each day should be done as worship. If you know that, then you won’t say, “I don’t have time to do puja.” That doesn’t mean that you should never do puja as puja. When you have the time, do that kind of puja also. God didn’t create us to sit in front of Him and talk about His glories. He sent us to do some work, to serve humanity, to take care of everything and everybody. In a way, we are all God’s babysitters. Each being is a child of God. Everything is God’s creation. That means your puppy is a child of God. Your pussycat is a child of God. So God has created you as a babysitter for all His children. You say, “Ohh, I want to please You, God.” But if you forget about all His children, and sit in front of Him and praise Him while the children cry, will you make a good babysitter? A babysitter is hired to take care of the babies. Likewise, we are created to serve everyone.'

When you sit for meditation, you are preparing yourself to apply that meditative attitude in all your actions. Puja or formal worship is also like that. To make the entire life an act of worship, you begin here. You are taking a vow, “My every act should be a worship like this.” It is almost like practicing at home before coming on stage. Once you are an expert dancer, you don’t have to practice at home. At any time you can just get up onto the stage. Still, even the experts need a little rehearsal. That is where the puja comes in. A little rehearsal before you begin the day. If you don’t have much time, a little time will do. It need not be elaborate.

God has brought you this far, and the same God will guide you continuously. If worldly administrators don’t appreciate you, don’t worry. The Chief Administrator will put you somewhere else. Remember, we are serving Him. All the rest is secondary. That confidence alone will help you. When you do things with total faith, total confidence, even the ordinary administrators will recognise and appreciate it. They will hesitate to interfere in your work. They will be afraid of you. Let them see your faith and the courage based on that faith in your actions. You can do that only if you develop total, implicit faith in that guidance.'

	readingtitle: 'Depend Entirely on God',
	readingbody: 'A beautiful story in the ancient Hindu scripture, the Mahabharata, clearly teaches what is meant by real surrender to God. A beautiful princess named Draupadi was brought to the king’s court. In the ancient days when you wanted to show that you had won a victory over someone, you did something that would damage his reputation. So the king decided to put Draupadi to shame by stripping her sari off. By doing this, he would ruin Draupadi’s husband’s reputation. A sari is six or seven yards of material which is gracefully wrapped around and tucked in with delicate folds. The king began to pull Draupadi’s sari, and though she was clutching it tightly, very soon he succeeded in pulling out one round and almost a second round of the sari. Draupadi was so frightened; she was crying out to God, in the form of Lord Krishna. “Krishna, Krishna!” she cried, but her cries went unanswered. In another minute, the entire sari would be pulled off. Her strength could never match the king’s. Realising the situation she thought to herself, “This is the final round of my sari; if I lost this also I will be doomed.” In that moment a great realisation dawned, “What am I doing? I cannot take care of myself anymore. Lord Krishna, if you want me to face this disgrace I will accept it. I totally trust you; my life is in your hands.” With that she let go of the sari and held her hands up and cried, “Krishna!” Draupadi just stood there calling and crying to Lord Krishna while the king mercilessly pulled the last round of her sari. But as he pulled, the cloth kept coming. After the last round, there was another, and another, and another. He pulled again and again, yet there seemed to be no end to the sari. He was pulling and pulling and pulling. Yards and yards and yards of sari seemed to be coming from somewhere. The King was soon exhausted and could pull no more. Draupadi was saved. This story illustrates a great truth. Even God cannot come and help you as long as you have faith in your own strength. If you are not totally surrendered, He says, “Okay, you still have strength, then why don’t you take care of yourself.” Complete surrender means to give up totally and depend entirely on God.'

You can perform any work with joy if you know that every job is equally good. You lose the joy of doing things when you don’t understand the importance of them, when you compare your work with someone else’s work. There is no blue collar work, white collar work. If you want to see it that way, your legs are doing blue collar work. Your head is doing white collar work. Is it not so? Your blue collar workers have to take the white collar worker where it wants to go. We are the ones who create all this superiority/inferiority. The world needs everything. Every action is equally good. Do them all with joy.'

	readingbody: 'Question: How can we cultivate the neutrality to evaluate our own thoughts and actions, which are so close to us? Sri Gurudev: Find out whether your own thoughts are based on selfishness or not. If your thoughts are based on selfishness, then they are always wrong. Because you are putting your own concern as your primary motive. You are not thinking of others. So naturally you will lean towards your own benefit. We have to analyse every thought, every action, with this guideline: “Am I doing it selflessly?” This might lead to another question: “What about my eating, sleeping, having certain facilities? Is it selfish for me to buy a house?” If you are doing it just for your sake, then yes, it is selfish. It’s not what you gather or keep with you that makes you selfish, but how you use them. Even your eating can be selfless if you are eating to get the energy to serve others. Every action should be based on some benefit to someone. You might wonder, “Shouldn’t I at least get some benefit?” You will get the most benefit if you think of the benefit of others. That’s why I sometimes say the most selfless person is the most selfish person, because by being selfless you keep yourself happy and peaceful always.'

	readingbody: 'Question: I want to know God, but I keep getting attracted to relationships. If God doesn’t want me to be married, why can’t He help me to want only Him? Sri Gurudev: That’s what He is doing. You are beginning to feel that way now. If He had given you a partner, you wouldn’t even be thinking this way, you wouldn’t even worry about knowing God. Now, because He didn’t give one to you, you are turning to Him. So, God is really interested in you. When He wants to help you in every way possible, He cuts off everything that would bind you. Everything that you are attached to, He cuts, “No, no, that’s not it, come to me.” Do you see? Is that not help? If He were not interested in you, He would say, “All right, do anything you want.” Because He’s interested in you, He doesn’t want you to get caught in anything else. You are really lucky that way. Oh yes. Don’t ever think that you are lucky if you get everything you want. No. If you don’t get what you want, then you are really lucky. That means God is taking all those things away so that you will not be distracted by them. You should be super happy if you don’t get everything you want, but it’s a hard truth to swallow. In many lives you see that God has given people everything, and they don’t even have time to think of Him. Doesn’t the Bible say that? A camel could go through the eye of a needle before God could enter into the heart of a rich man. What do you mean by rich man? So many entanglements, so many attachments, so much accumulation. Even if God wants to get in, there’s no room. So don’t worry. The very fact that you are not getting any partner means that God seems to be after you.'

To find God you don’t need to do anything. Neither taking sanyas, nor having a family, nor living in an ashram, nor having anything is going to bring God. The minute you know that everything is nothing but emptiness, the minute you realise that God cannot be gotten from outside by doing something, then you have god. Some marry and try to get God. Some renounce and try to get God. They all ultimately want to find that joy. We should all know that it’s not by doing a certain thing or by not doing a certain thing that you are going to achieve this. It is the attitude in the mind, not the state or position. It doesn’t matter what you are, what you do. It’s the knowledge. That’s why whether it is a renounced life or a married life is immaterial. Learn to keep your peace.'

If you really want to attract somebody, if you want to get somebody’s love, you must serve that person. You must do all that you can to attract that person so he or she will love you. You give everything, even your life, to that person. It’s also like that with God. God is here in the form of humanity, in the form of nature. So you say, “I am ready to give anything and everything in the name of God.” Serve, serve, serve. That doesn’t mean you just simply go, sit in a corner and cry. Serving God is loving God. By serving and loving, you get His Grace. You make Him love you. A devotee is not a useless person simply sitting and crying. He serves everybody, everything in the name of God. Serving and loving are the ways to attain God. What is God? Who is that? Peace of mind is God. So you are ready to renounce anything and everything to retain your peace, and that is God. You can never maintain that peace if you are running after things, if you are looking for that peace outside. God is in you in the form of peace and joy.'

	readingbody: 'Question: How can I know when to serve others and when it is best for me to say no without guilt? Sri Gurudev: You yourself should know how much you can give. You cannot give beyond your capacity. If you have done a lot of service that day, and if you are really tired, you should say no. Otherwise you are saying no to your own body or mind. In the name of helping others, you should not put your body into a situation where it might get hurt. Your conscience will tell you if you are just finding an excuse; but if you really need the rest, then you can honestly say no. You don’t have to feel guilty about it. Why should you feel guilty? Nobody expects you to go beyond your capacity. If you try to do something beyond your capacity, you might even make a mess of it. So, know your capacity, know your limitations. Then offer your services. There’s no need to feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty, then maybe you can do it but you just don’t want to. If your conscience is clear, you don’t have to feel guilty. Ask advice from your own pure Self. Your conscience is always clean. That’s the part of God in you. It’s what you call the guru within. It’s not necessary to always get advice from someone outside. The conscience is constantly giving us advice, but often we don’t listen to it. We don’t even want to listen. Someone else can only help you for a while. You should learn to ask that buddy within. Sometimes you might feel a conflict: “I don’t know which is the Self and which is the ego. One says ‘Do it;’ the other says, ‘Don’t do it.’” In that case go to someone who is capable of recognising the difference. But ultimately we have to develop the capacity to discriminate within ourselves. That is why meditation is so important. Until you become established in that, at least in meditation you should be able to hear your own inner Self.'

	readingbody: 'Question: You have said that god is neutral. You have also said He can approve or disapprove of our plans and intentions. Please explain how both can be true. Sri Gurudev: When I said that God is neutral, that was true. And when I said that He approves and disapproves that was also true. The sun’s rays don’t have any colour, it’s true. But when those same rays pass through a prism, you see all the seven colours; isn’t that also true? So you see things in a different light depending upon whether you are looking from this side of the prism or that side of the prism. Either one could be true, because absolute Truth is totally different. The mind can never grasp the absolute Truth because the mind itself is limited. If the mind wants to grasp something it colours it according to its own state. So you can see God as someone who is supervising everything, or as someone who is approving and disapproving, like your conscience. Your conscience is that part of God that is within you. It doesn’t approve of everything you want to do. God would disapprove just as your conscience does, but He won’t stop you if you still want to do it. In that way, He is neutral. The light from the sun is there. In that light, you might see a big ditch in the road. If, after seeing the ditch, you close your eyes and walk, will the sun come and stop you? No. The sun showed you the ditch, but it won’t stop you from falling in. What you do about the ditch is your business. In that way God is neutral. God just presents the facts and allows you to listen or to not listen. Then you face whatever comes. In the absolute sense, God is not doing anything; but that can be experienced only when you transcend the mind and get beyond its limitations. Until then, we just have to understand it as “my will,” and “God’s Will.”'

I know what he would say to me.” Then follow it; you have the master, or the spiritual guide, or the guru there. The guru is not just the physical body; it is the teachings. Even if you don’t have a guru, even if you have no one to advise you, if you learn to listen within, your own conscience will guide you. The guru is not a person somewhere. Your conscience always tells you what is right and what is wrong. That is the guru within. Listen to that, and follow it.'

	readingbody: 'Divine Will has no tinge of selfishness. Ego means selfishness, “I,” “me,” “I am doing this for my sake.” So, whatever you will to do for your sake is egoistic and will have its own return. We have to face it. But without the ego, we would say, “Some Cosmic Power makes me work. The God in me motivates me. He sent me here and He is making me do everything. I am an instrument. He gave me everything. He may take it all back. Nothing belongs to me. Not even the body belongs to me.” We should perform all our actions with this feeling, free from egoism. That is Divine Will. Your conscience prompts you, not the ego. The conscience will always say, “It’s good for everybody.” Don’t even pray, “Let me be happy, Help me. Make me good.” Always think in terms of the cosmos: “Sarveshaam swastir bhavatu” — “May all be happy.” So, keep on bringing it into the mind, “Thy Will be done. It’s all for Jesus, all for Moses, all for Buddha, all for Allah.” Use any name, it doesn’t matter. “All for the Ashram. All for the Cosmic Consciousness. Nothing for me. I’m not even eating for my sake. I am eating because I have to serve.” That should be the thought behind our every act. The minute you begin to live that way, your life will be totally, totally different. You will enjoy supreme joy. You will not be affected by these petty little things. We should always roar like lions, “I am that I am! I am ever joyful, ever peaceful! None of this nonsense will affect me!” We must have that strength and courage. Even if you act temporarily, “I am a super yogi!” for one week, you will see the difference. It’s not just to be read, or heard or preached. It should be lived. And you can live that life. Don’t say, “Oh, that is only fit for saints. I am just an ordinary person.” You are not ordinary, If you were ordinary, you wouldn’t even be here. Nobody is ordinary here. No. Even a thorn has a purpose. It had been placed here for a particular cause and it is unique in its place. Nothing can be substituted for that. Nobody can replace you. You are unique in your position. Don’t try to compare yourself with others. You are all-important. Everybody is needed in this cosmos. Be proud of your existence.'

What we want is to have the right thoughts, ones that would not disturb the mind. Thoughts are of two kinds: working thoughts and playing thoughts. In working thoughts, you get tensed up, you become anxious. In playing thoughts, you are relaxed. So convert all of your thoughts into playing thoughts. Play while you work.

But what about your attitude when you deal with people, when you work with them day in and day out? That is where you have to prove that you have achieved something in your spiritual practices. If a person practices adapting, adjusting and accommodating, he would never point a finger at others and blame them. Even if another person is at fault, if you know how to adapt, adjust and accommodate, you are able to rise above those situations. Still, the most difficult thing is to bear insult and injury.

Yes, you might have some visions, you might see some lights, hear some sounds, all right. What is the benefit that those things bring to others? The real experience is to move around with a smiling face, a loving face. That is spiritual: to see the spirit in others, to love everybody. To rise above these differences of the lower nature. Real spiritual experience brings harmony. What is the use of those other experiences if you can’t live comfortably, harmoniously, lovingly with ten people? Everybody should love you. To me that is what you call spiritual experience. Keep that in mind. “I will live a life that will make everybody love me.

Touch your own heart and question yourself, “Am I loved by everyone? Do I love everyone? Or is there any dislike towards anybody?” Go to that person, shake his or her hand and say, “I’m sorry I had this kind of feeling. It’s terrible, it makes me sick. I am sorry.” That is worth a hundred days’ meditation. Have no ill feeling toward anyone. The moment you have some difference of opinion or any feelings of suspicion, go, immediately talk to that person. Say, “I am getting a feeling like this. Please, I must clarify it. Come on, let’s get that over with.” Don’t even allow it to stay in your heart for a few hours. Sometimes these kinds of feelings come up. It’s natural; but don’t go to sleep like that. Before you go to bed, it should be cleared up. Don’t you brush your teeth before you go to bed? You go to bed with clean teeth, is it not so? In the same way, brush your heart also.

I sometimes become impatient and anxious, begin to lack faith and trust, and feel pressured because of my age. Do you have any suggestions? Sri Gurudev: God has a purpose for having you here, but you may want to do something of your own. If God really wanted you to get married and have a family, even if you didn’t want it, somebody would have come and kidnapped you. Sometimes we want many things, but the Higher Will says, “It’s not good for you. I have not created you for that purpose.” Or, “You are not ready for it.” You might say, “No, I am thirty-three. I am ready.” Well, to God maybe you are still a thirty-three month old baby. You think you are ready but God still says no. We sometimes think that we all should be doing the same thing. That is not so. It is that Cosmic Consciousness, which we call God, that created everything and everybody for a certain purpose. The purpose need not be the same for everyone. He functions through all the people to fulfill His cosmic mission. Maybe you are supposed to do something without getting into family life. By not accepting that, you are not fulfilling your duty as a single person; neither are you getting into family life as you wanted. So you are losing both. You are neither following God’s Will, nor following your will. You are revolting against God: “I don’t want to be like that. I want to be like this.” And God is not allowing you to be the way you want. When you don’t want to be that and God doesn’t want you to be this, it’s a constant fight. We all have some purpose to fulfill. You are unique in your place. Just be contented, “God has created me for some purpose. Let me fulfill whatever it is. Even if I don’t know what I am doing.” If you ask God, He will say, “I have a purpose for you. Just wait. I don’t need to be using everybody, every day, all the time.” So just be contented.

It’s not easy to talk and still be respected. If it were my choice, I would prefer to be silent. But then I think, “Why should I be silent? Am I talking? No. Someone makes me talk, and I talk. If He makes me keep quiet, I will keep quiet.” That’s all. When you have this feeling, the talking is not your talking. You are just a speaker, and somebody else is talking through it. So you don’t need to worry about that. Don’t have any want of your own. Whatever has to happen through you, let it happen. If you are made to talk, talk. If you are made to sleep, sleep. If you are made to eat, eat. Then you don’t need to worry about any of these things. Resign yourself completely into the hands of God, into the hand of the unseen power that functions through you.

Suppose the wind comes and the leaf gets carried up and dropped on the top of a church. If another gust comes and it is thrown on top of a manure pile, then what? It’s still a dry leaf.

	readingbody: 'Question: Can a little lie told to a person be loving and actually prevent hurt? Sri Gurudev: Well, I have a philosophy about that. What is a lie? Is a lie something terrible? Is it always bad to lie? If so, why should there even be such a thing as a lie at all in this universe? Why has lying been created? Lying by itself is not bad. You can lie under certain conditions. If it is going to produce at least some benefit to somebody and no harm to anybody, then even a lie is the truth. In the same way, don’t think that your own golden truth is always wonderful. Sometimes truth can be more terrible than lying. Would you like an example? Once upon a time there lived a sadhu, a wandering mendicant, in a remote wooded area. He lived in a nice, small hut. One fine day a young, beautiful girl who was wearing all kinds of nice jewels, diamonds, rubies and what not, came running up to him. “Swami, please help me.” He was startled to see the young girl. She said, “Please, somebody is chasing me to rob me of all these things. He may even kill me. Please let me hide somewhere.” And without even waiting for his permission, she just ran into the hut and hid herself in a corner. Within a few minutes, a terrible looking man with a nice dagger in his hand came running by. “Hey, sadhu. Did a young girl come by here?” Sadhus should not tell lies, isn’t it so? What should he say? The truth and nothing but the truth? How many of you would tell the truth? Probably not even one. The sadhu said, “What? What do you mean by that? Why would a young girl come here? Don’t you see that I am a sadhu and this is a hermitage? This is no place for young girls.” “Oh, so you didn’t see anyone?” “Why are you looking for a young girl here? I am just an old man living in a forest.” Did he tell the truth? No. So, it’s a lie, in a way. He didn’t say, “No”; he just questioned the man. And by doing so, he saved 3 lives: the life of the girl, his own life, and the life of the thief. The thief was ready to kill the girl to get the jewels; then he would have had to kill the sadhu who would have been a witness; and the police would have caught the thief and put him to death. So, don’t worry about whether something is the truth or a lie. Think about what the outcome of it is. Always look at the outcome of your actions and the motive with which you perform them. The sadhu was not really cheating the man by that lie; in fact, he saved that man’s life by preventing the crime. He wished well for him, so his lie had a good intention and a beautiful outcome. That’s how we should think. In that sense, there is nothing bad in this whole universe.'

When you have something, you want to show it off. Learning to fight is not going to help you in defending yourself or in any other way. The best way to defend yourself is with your mental poise and courage. Why is somebody going to beat you up? Think about it. Why should he beat you? Maybe he has some grudge against you. He thinks of you as an enemy. Find out the cause. If there is some fault on your side, go, apologise, make him your friend. You might say, “No, no, no, it’s just a man on the road, some crazy fellow.” If you are really innocent, you will send out a beautiful, innocent vibration. He may come near you, but he will forget to attack you. So the best defense is to keep a clean and serene mind; smile at him. If he still wants to come and hit you, you should have the courage to say, “Yes, if you like to do it and if you think that you are going to enjoy it, do it. I am ready to make you happy. Is that what you want? Do it.” He will never touch you then.'

	readingtitle: 'You Are Really Giving a Better Lesson',
	readingbody: 'When Lord Jesus said, “If somebody slaps you on one cheek, show the other cheek also,” what did that mean? By showing the other cheek you are really giving the person a better lesson. You make him feel ashamed of what he has done. If you return another slap, you are only beating his body. If you follow this advice of Jesus, you are beating the mind, the ego. It takes more courage and strength to smile at a person who hates you than to hit back. It is here that the idea of karma can be helpful. If somebody just comes and hits you for no reason, stop and think to yourself, “Probably this is my karma. I must have hit somebody sometime in the past and escaped from getting hit or being punished for it. Now this person is returning what I gave out.” Accept it. Certainly there is no effect without a cause. Nobody can come and hit you if you are really that innocent. When somebody suddenly hits you, he is just giving you what you failed to receive from the other person to whom you gave something. You should thank him. “You have helped me to purge this karma at last. Thank you so much.” At the same time you are teaching him a lesson. So this is the best way to do it. Fighting is never going to stop another fight. Only love, not more hatred, will heal hatred.'

	readingbody: 'Question: Before I believed, I created much bad karma in this life. Now I am frightened most of the time about how I must pay it back. How can I handle this fear? Sri Gurudev: Your fear is unnecessary. We all make mistakes, Once you realise that you have made a mistake, repent. Learn the lessons from the mistakes that you make. Failures are stepping stones to future success. If you are going to brood over your past mistakes and be afraid that something terrible will happen, you will just waste your time. Nothing will happen. Nature’s grace is such that it will pardon any mistake, because only by mistakes do you learn. If a child is going to think of all the falls it had while it was learning to walk, it will never walk. So treat the falls as stepping stones. If you have the opportunity to see the people you wronged, go to them with all courage and apologise. Say, “I made a mistake. I was a fool. I was ignorant, I didn’t know what I was doing. Please excuse me.” That is the only way to repay your debts. If you cannot see these people, if they are not here anymore, at least mentally pray for them. Think of them. Send your apologies to them. That way you can pay them back and it won’t affect you.'

	readingbody: 'When you pray, you send out healing vibrations and good thoughts into the cosmos. They circulate there. If you pray for a particular individual, no matter where that individual is, your thought forms go there and reach that person. The person may not even know that you are praying for his or her welfare, but will be able to receive it and be helped. Sometimes your prayers are universal; in that case, those who have an open sail will catch it. But you can personalise it also, and it will certainly be received. If a person’s karma is strong and your prayer is not that strong, you cannot even penetrate into it. Then what is the use of praying? When others know that so many people are praying for them, it will give them comfort. And even if some people do not want your prayer, you can still pray. By praying for others, you get the benefit yourself, because you are opening up your own heart. You are showing your compassionate side. Your mind gets purified when you pray for others. You become a better person. Through your prayer you are expressing your faith in God. It is not that karma can be alleviated or even eradicated by prayers. Instead, your prayers act as an anaesthesia so that the person doesn’t go through the operation with pain. In numerous ways, prayer certainly helps. It is a powerful, powerful practice. Many, many things can happen by prayer. Radical minds may not accept or understand it. But a sincere prayer that comes from a faithful heart can perform miracles. So have that faith. Pray for yourself, pray for others. You will certainly purify your heart.'

And whoever thinks of that reality and works to realise the reality are the chosen people. They may be living in Africa, or Australia, or Himalayan cave or Katmandu, it doesn’t matter. Whoever is interested in reality is an Israelite. So this song is addressed to the true children of that absolute reality: “Hear, O children of the reality!

Unfortunately, we seldom see that reflection of God inside, which is in you as you. The duty of the spiritual teacher is to act as a mirror to show you the Light within. And it is the Light within that helps you realise God. That Light does not shine just within a few individual sages or saints. If you care to learn, you can learn from anything and everything. A speck of dust can teach you something. A plant can teach you something. A seed can teach you something. A worm can teach you something. A bird, a beast, a stone. You can learn something from a thief. If you really want to learn, everything can teach you. The unfortunate thing is that everyone wants to teach, no one wants to learn. Sage Thiruvalluvar says, “Who is great? The one who does what is not easy.” Anybody can do everyday things: find a little food and a little shelter, build a family, have a little fun. There is no greatness in it. Many people do that. Even animals do that. So what should we do that is difficult? Know the Truth. It is for that sake you need the help of someone who has already seen the Light.'

	readingbody: 'Question: Would you please say something about fear? Sometimes I wake up at night and do not know who or where I am, except that my heart is pounding because I am so frightened. Sri Gurudev: The part that sleeps in a sleeping state is the conscious mind. The subconscious mind can still function. When the conscious mind sleeps and the subconscious mind functions, you call it a dream. If the subconscious mind also sleeps, that is what you call sleep. When the conscious mind sleeps, the fear that is in the subconscious mind takes the opportunity to come to the surface. Probing into that fear is almost like analysing the garbage before throwing it out. Instead of worrying about what caused the fear, replace it with something positive. Say, “Whatever it is, it’s not something that happened before. I’m not going to worry about it. It’s not going to affect me anymore. I am bold. I am strong. I am consciously doing the right things. I am practicing yoga. I am doing a lot of prayer and meditation. I trust in God. I love everybody. I don’t need to be afraid of anyone in this world because all people are my brothers and sisters. Everyone is my own Self.” See? Din the positive thoughts into the subconscious mind with the conscious mind. Consciously work at it. When the positive thoughts go in they will squeeze the undesirable thoughts out of the subconscious. Modern psychology seems to be interested in probing into it, “What caused it? Is it your father, mother?” Yoga doesn’t worry about that. Ignore it. The more you think about it, the more you are encouraging it. The more you think about a thought, the more it gets strengthened. Any thought. If you ignore it, you are starving it. By putting in positive thoughts, the fear will go away.'

At the same time, look for help. The devil is powerful, no doubt. You cannot handle him by yourself. If you say, “I can win over him,” you might fail. So it’s at such times that you say, “God, I cannot do it by myself. I need Your help.” Think of God more, pray sincerely, repeat your mantram more. If the devil knows that you are calling for help, he won’t just stand there. He knows that you are calling somebody greater than himself. He knows that he is in trouble. He wants to save his life. The mantram is your help. Shout it. The mantram is your protection and a shield around you. Wear the mantra as your armor. There’s no greater power than that. It’s the devil against the Divine. But you must have that kind of confidence. If you don’t have that confidence and you still shout, the devil knows that. You should be totally, totally confident in what you are doing.

	readingbody: 'Question: Why do we want so much to be loved, instead of just being contented to love others? Why do we crave emotional comfort and want others to care about us? Sri Gurudev: Because we still have not realised that there is somebody in us always, who is caring for us every minute, who is loving us every minute. If we realise that, why do we want somebody else to love us? In a way, the more you look for somebody else to love you, the more you might not get that love. Failing to get love from outside yourself may actually be helpful, because ultimately it will make you turn inward and say, “Nobody seems to be loving me. God, You are the only one to love me.” If others love you, you will forget God, “God, I am happy with that person. I don’t need to worry about You now.” Yes, when everything fails you turn to God. In a way, God seems to really be loving you. That’s the very reason He doesn’t want anybody to love you or doesn’t want you to go looking for love anywhere else. He is helping you to turn toward Him. If we feel that Presence in us, where is the need for any other comfort? The best Comforter is inside. All other kinds of comfort are temporary. They come, and there will be a time when they must go. Don’t depend on something that comes from outside. Outside things are never going to make you happy. And it should  be that way, so that one day you will realise that there is always someone to love and comfort us inside.'

The secret is to always look for opportunities to help others; look for ways to be nice to them. Sometimes they might even be nasty to you; if so, ignore it, forget it. Maybe that is the way they are; but we should be nice to them. Even if someone says, “Oh, you’re a fool,” you should say, “Thank you.” Don’t retaliate with the same kind of words. Soon they will get tired of all that. Afterwards, they will even feel ashamed. The great sage Thiruvalluvar said that if people do something wrong to you or hurt you, do something really good for them in return. That is the best punishment. Why? Because they will be so embarrassed to have done that to you. It is in our hands. We can always make friends with anyone and everyone if we have the patience and understanding.'

If he is happy and contented with what you have given, why would he be running away? There’s nothing wrong in his wanting to expand, to learn more. Don’t you want him to be happy? He is growing in the right direction. If you really love him, let him go.” But whatever happens, no seeker, no young person should ever hate his or her parents; you will never grow by hating. You should try and try and try to get the blessings of the parents for your spiritual growth. Try your best. Sometimes if the parents are really against your spiritual pursuit, tell them, “All right, Mom, Dad, if you really don’t want me to follow that, would you prefer for me to go to nightclubs and drink or take drugs? Then will you be happy?” Ask them. “Oh, no, we don’t want you to do that.” “Then why can’t you allow me to do this? What is the use of both of us being unhappy?

That is the one that is not so good, the one that might have hurt us. We should forget it immediately. We should not even remember it for the next hour. Then we will not have anybody as an enemy. Why do we call someone an enemy? Because we remember the harm that might have been done to us. If we forget it, there won’t be any enemy, is it not so? Enemies are created by our remembering what harm has been done to us. We create our enemies by remembering their misdeeds. If we have forgotten that, and if we remember all of the good deeds, even if somebody wants to be our enemy, he cannot because we see him as our friend. No one is one hundred percent good or one hundred percent bad. People do many good things. Maybe once in a while, because of their lower nature, they might do something bad also.

When you have all three, and waste them, God will not kindle you up or say, “Come on, wake up!” No. He has given you everything possible. We have done a lot of meritorious deeds. We have gone through a lot of births and deaths. Whether you believe in reincarnation or not, it is a fact. You are not simply jumping into a human form right away. The soul has traveled a long way. You are almost at your journey’s end: animal to human, human to superhuman. Unconscious to subconscious to conscious to superconscious. The Bhagavad Gita says that at the last minute, desire becomes very strong. Your very strong desires will come to the surface at the last minute, because at that time your body and mind — everything — is weak. You are already getting ready to leave, so everything is shattered. All the desires that have somehow been suppressed, but not annihilated, will be waiting there. All of a sudden, the strongest desire will come up, and when the soul leaves the body, it goes with that desire. That is why we should be very, very careful about what desires we cultivate. There may be many other little desires, it doesn’t matter; but our predominant desire should be something elevating. Something that would take you away from this to a higher level, never something that would take you backward. So even if someone all of a sudden gives you a good spanking, you should say, “Hari OM!” Yes. If a thorn pricks you, “Hari OM!” If you get a shock, “Hari OM!” Develop that and you have a chance. Repeat the holy name always; not necessarily “Hari OM,” but any holy name. When you wake up it should come with the waking. When you go to bed, it should go with you to bed. You have to cultivate that. You cannot say, “Ahh, I can easily develop it later on. Why should I bother about it now?” No. Make hay while the sun shines.'

It comes like a cloud and you can blow it away. Shout at the top of your voice, “I am blissful, I am joyful, I am easeful.” You are nothing less than that. Ascertain your true nature. Don’t constantly hypnotise yourself saying, “Oh, I am a mortal, I am a sinner, I am this, I am that.” You’re not. If you keep on thinking that way, you will become that. As you think, so you become. Think that you are great, you are great. Think that you are hopeless, certainly you will become hopeless. Don’t give room for negative thinking. Always have positive, positive, positive thoughts. People who pan for gold collect tons of crude rock. If they just saw the crudeness, they would throw it all away. Instead, their eye is on the few ounces of gold hidden within that rock. If you keep your eye on the gold, you won’t get tired of cleaning the rock; and ultimately you will get the gold. Never lose sight of the gold in you. You might have accumulated a lot of dirt and dust. It doesn’t matter. Take the time to clean it out. Keep your mind on the gold that you are looking for.'

	readingbody: 'It is of no use to blame or dislike others. If you don’t like someone, you don’t have to go near that person. But don’t create problems for the person or condemn him or her either. It is even better to try to find out why you don’t like someone. analyse it. You may not like certain things he or she does. Fine, but you should ask yourself, “Haven’t I done the same thing before?” Maybe you have learned that lesson and you are not doing it now. The other person is still making that mistake, and will learn the lesson just as you did. Allow others to learn in their own time. Have compassion and understanding. When you think in this way, you stop disliking the person. You may even be able to help the person. But if you cannot, allow that one to take his or her own time to learn and grow. We are not all at the same level. With the proper understanding, you will not have any difficulty in liking everyone. If you dislike someone, it’s your mistake because you lack understanding. That person might be a terrible sinner who made a lot of mistakes, but your dislike is also a mistake. So if you cannot help the person, at least do not dislike him or her. You have probably done the same thing before but have just forgotten about it. People grow by making mistakes. That is why we should never hesitate to give more chances to people. Give a helping hand rather than a condemning one.'

So it retains its pure consciousness state, but it doesn’t retain the individual consciousness that is part of the mind. Once you achieve that state, the product of the mind is gone, like a dream that is gone when you wake up. The mental consciousness constantly varies. All your ideas, thoughts, experiences are not stored in the Self, but in the mind. Here we should understand the difference between soul and Self. The soul is a mixture of Self and mind. Or, in other words, the soul is the Self reflected in the mind, the mental mirror. So it is a reflection of the Self that you call soul, and that seems to have all the colours and the modifications of the mind. But once you raise your level of consciousness to pure consciousness, then there is no mind at all. Along with the mind, all this mental dream goes away. You don’t retain any of those old memories. But until that total liberation, you do retain them.'

But we don’t know His purpose behind it all, and so we seem to be missing all the fun. Just treat everything as play. All this coming and going, meeting, eating, welcoming, sending off, taking birth, saying goodnight and goodbye. It’s all fun. We should see it in this light and take things easy. It’s all a great, divine play and we all have our roles. Don’t even say that we are playing our roles. We are all puppets; there is a wire tied to us. That wire is Cosmic Consciousness. We all have that Consciousness. Whatever that Consciousness thinks, we think. But when we fail to understand that, and allow our individual egos to come to the surface, we think that we are doing something. That is what you call basic ignorance. Actually we have no business of our own here at all. Nothing belongs to us. Not even these bodies, not even these minds. Just because we happen to have something in our hands, we immediately try to possess it. We say, “This is mine. I should keep it. I did it.” Our “I” gets cataracted by too many mines.” If we could just perform an operation on that cataract, we would see better. So just leave it to the Lord.

You sometimes forget this and take life too seriously. At least when it gets too tough and you are really caught up in it all, at that point sit back and say, “It’s all right.” Don’t be serious about anything, anything, anything. Just have fun. Always keep this awareness of the Divine Leela or God’s Play. If we just remember this, we won’t be projecting our ego. How often we get caught in thinking, “I did it! I got it! I lost it!” For one week, try saying: “It’s all God’s fun. I’ll simply do whatever He wants me to do.” Have a sample week like this. You will feel very light. You will get the Light.

No. So you are imagining, “That must be God. God should be like this. God should be like that.” That is your God. Another person would imagine the same God in his or her own way. That is why even God’s form varies according to the person who imagines God. That is the proof that everything comes from within. In meditation you are imagining something that you want to ultimately become or develop. “God is almighty, God is all-powerful, God is all-forgiving, God is all love.” You constantly think of certain things and the mind assumes that image, assumes that quality. But one thing is important: you should think strongly. You should be strong enough in your suggestions. That is what you are trying to develop in your meditation. You are strengthening your thoughts by constantly thinking of the same thing. To make yourself strong in your thoughts, you have to keep on bringing that into your mind. “This is what I want to become. This is what I want to become.” That means you imagine that you are going to be like that — that you are that. Then certainly you will become that.

That’s why we say the entire world is your own projection. You project your image onto everything; everything is seen with your own vision. In that sense we are continuously imagining. Even your living is your imagination. Because you are imagining that you are alive, you are alive. If you seriously begin to imagine that you are dying little by little, you will die. It has been proven. If you seriously imagine that you are losing all of your strength, in half an hour you will collapse. It will happen. Always remember to think beautiful, positive thoughts.

If you don’t care to borrow it, there’s no sorrow for you. That’s all. You are the cause of your worry. Nobody can bring worry to you. If you care, decide not to worry. Remember, worry is not going to bring anything to us. On the other hand, it will sap away even the little energy, the little capacity, that we may have. A worried doctor cannot operate, you all know that. A worried student cannot write an exam. Go with full confidence. Just say, “I’m doing all that I can.” That’s it. We make things change. Everything takes its own time. We are in a hurry to change things. We want everything instantaneously. Allow nature to have its say. Nature is God.

	readingbody: 'Question: What can people do who have a tendency to judge themselves harshly or to look very negatively at themselves? Sri Gurudev: The question is not about self-judgement, but about self-negativity, or having a poor opinion of yourself. Certainly, that will affect your heart, your mind, and your personality. What you think you ultimately become. Don’t we say that? “As you think, so you become.” If you are thinking negatively about yourself, you don’t need any negativity to come from somewhere else. You are negating yourself. So, you have to analyse it. “Is this good for me? Is it helpful for me to have these negative thoughts? Is it constructive or destructive? I become what I think. If my thoughts are like this, what will I become?” When you realise that, you won’t want to do it anymore. Often people don’t take it seriously; but your own negative thoughts will affect you. That’s why, at least for our own sake, if not for the sake of others, we should not develop any negative thoughts about ourselves or about anybody else. No one interested in his or her own welfare, physical and mental, should invite negative thoughts. In the same way, how does one find self-love? Love yourself. Think of that. “I am God’s child. God has given me all these gifts. I love myself because God is functioning through me.” Even if you have some disabilities, it doesn’t matter; still you don’t have to think that God doesn’t love you. No. That’s where the theory of karma comes in. You must have done something before that brought it to you. Think, “God is merciful so He is purging me of my karma by making me go through this.” There must be a cause; nothing happens without a cause. So think of all these things, “Yes, God loves me. I’m the dear, dear child of God.” Think of all the gifts that God has given you. You will learn to love God, and by loving God you will love yourself also.'

And who is the cause of it? Myself! So at least for my own sake, I should stop it.” If you are jealous because you see someone else getting something that you are not getting, find out the reason. Why is that person getting all the attention or progressing, growing well in everything? What is the secret of that person’s growth? Think of that, instead of simply feeling jealous. Find out his or her secret. Jealousy means that when others are doing well, you feel unhappy about it. If you really look into it, you might find that there is a nice, good attitude in their life. Maybe they are not running after things; they are contented with what they have. They have more faith, more devotion. They put themselves in the position to receive. By thinking of the good qualities of others, you will also develop them and your life will be so beautiful. Automatically when you feel that contentment, things will come to you by themselves.

Meditation is the sustaining force. And don’t say, “Ohh, if I come to meditation I can’t fulfill my other obligations.” Or, “I have to stay up late so I can’t get up that early.” These are all just excuses. They come out of the minds that do not know the importance of it. Meditation takes care of your body and mind and activities. So I would say that everybody should make a point of meditating. We need the mind. It is with the mind that we do everything. The mind is our key. If that key is not kept in good shape, how are you going to perform your duties? The one and only way to keep the mind in good shape, to keep the mind clean and sharp, is by meditation. So, make all the effort that’s necessary to be regular in meditation. If you meditate regularly, you will have no complaints in life. All of your problems would solve themselves if you were regular in your meditation. Through meditation, the mind gets the capacity to solve problems and rise above difficulties. The people who complain, “Oh, I am this, I am that, I don’t get this, I don’t get that. I feel this way, I feel that way, physically, mentally,” who have constant complications, would find that it all could be easily burnt out by regular meditation.

A play has every role. Probably you are just acting your part. So if you are a gatekeeper standing in front of the gate while the king is sitting on the throne, why should you feel intimidated? Without you the play can’t be enacted. It is only during the play that you are here and he is there. When the curtain falls, you embrace each other and laugh at it, “Hey, you did very well playing the part of a king.” We all have to play our roles. What is unimportant in this world? Nothing. God has never created anything that is unimportant. If you think, “I am also equally God’s child. He created me like this. I am happy to be like this,” how can anyone intimidate you? It’s your own wrong notion about yourself. You think little of yourself. You don’t think you are potentially divine. You don’t think that you are the child of God, created by God. If you are a lion cub, and if you forget that and bleat like a lamb, who can help you? Rise up, exert your birthright, affirm your true nature: “I am that I am. I am nothing less than God, my Father.” Then even if someone says, “Hey, you are a fox,” you will say, “Maybe that’s what you see. I know I am a lion.” Yes. That’s what. Realising the true nature of the Self will take you away from all these problems. You are the same always, eternally. You are that immortal soul. Nothing less than that.

Sri Gurudev: How do you know that you have not seen Him? I heard Him saying, “I have been in front of this person so many times, but he never even recognised Me. He was calling, calling, calling for Me. So I went there many times, stood right in front of him, and he didn’t even bother to look at Me. He just brushed Me aside and kept on saying, ‘God, where are You? Where are You?’” Before you look for God, you should know what He looks like, or at least what God is. God has no particular form, but He appears in all forms and names. It is with His consciousness that I am saying all these things; and with His consciousness, you are listening. To simplify it, we say that God is all consciousness — super consciousness, cosmic consciousness — or peace. God is already there in you as peace, but you disturb your peace by searching for God. Stop searching and disturbing your peace, and you will experience God. A disturbed mind can never understand God. Looking for God is not our first and foremost duty. Our first and foremost duty is to take care not to let the mind lose its peace. You don’t have to make the mind peaceful. If you leave it alone, it is peaceful. In our own lives we should see that we don’t lose our peace due to our thoughts, words, actions. Learn to remain undisturbed, unshakeable, as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar. You should treasure the peace of your mind so much that nothing, nothing, nothing would shake you. You should be ready to renounce anything and everything that is going to disturb your peace. Name, fame, money, power, position, relatives, friends — all should be secondary to maintaining your peace. Everything else is nothing compared to peace of mind.

Even that is divided into three: Sat, chid, ananda. What is sat? Truth, existence. What is. That is sat. That means the essential reality, the truth, or the existence. Chid is knowledge.

No matter what you are and how you are, you see that unconditional love from God. God never said, “I will love you if only you do this, if only you are like that.” No. Loving without limitations is “universal love.” And that is God. If you want to experience that God in your life, love everything and everybody as God would love. Unconditionally. Show the same love to one and all. Let nothing get harmed, hurt, or pained, even by your thought. It is possible to develop a life like that. We want everybody to love us, and we don’t want anybody to hate us. In the same way, everybody would want that. Do unto others as you yourself would want it to be done unto you. Spiritual teaching is very simple. Whether you repeat your mantram or not, whether you practice hatha yoga or not, whether you learn all the scriptures by heart or not, who worries about that? But, do you have unconditional love in your life? If you have that, you have everything.

Sri Gurudev: In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says clearly, “Whenever there is too much unrighteousness in the world, I come to educate people.” That teacher is what you call an avatar or divine incarnation. When such an incarnation comes, nobody can keep it hidden. It will be made known to all. But the name and form will not necessarily be the same each time. That’s where many people make a mistake. They look for another person exactly like Jesus, even in appearance. But it need not be that way. Sometimes you cannot easily recognise such an incarnation until you see the great qualities expressed in his or her life. But that doesn’t mean that we are not helped until a great avatar comes and is revealed to the world. God’s spirit is always there. Christ is always there in spirit. He may even be seen in some other name, some other form. The great incarnations come mainly when the whole world is in trouble, and everyone really looks for that help and prays. Other than that, individually you may come across your second comings. The spirit never leaves us alone and goes somewhere, waiting for another time to come. To the spirit, there is no coming or going. It’s only an expression. God never comes and never goes. God is. And God is omnipresent. From where would He come?

It is all given to you by God. When you have emptied your mind of ownership, that is renunciation or poverty. I will give you a small illustration. Once King Janaka was studying under a great sage. He used to leave the palace and go to the hermitage and sit with all the other students to study the scriptures under the guidance of a swami. It seemed to the other students, however, that the teacher was treating the king a little specially. Naturally they became jealous, so they were gossiping. The sage knew what was happening, but he allowed it to continue for a while. Ordinarily in those days in the hermitages the swamis used to sit and teach under a tree. One hermitage happened to be on the outskirts of the king’s palace. One day the swami created the illusion that the palace was on fire. The ministers and servants from the palace came running saying that the palace was on fire and the fire was spreading. Immediately all the students got up and ran; but Janaka, the king himself, was just sitting there contemplating on what the teacher was saying. The swami was talking about the steadiness of the spirit, and Janaka was contemplating on that. He didn’t even hear what was happening. So all the other students got up and ran. After a few minutes though, they all came back saying, “It was just a false alarm. There is no fire at all. We don’t know what happened.” The swami said, “Ah, is that all? Thank God! Okay, sit. But when the palace was on fire, why did you people run to put the fire out? The palace is far away. Are there not people there to do those things?” “Oh, no, we weren’t worried about the palace. But our loincloths were hanging on a line very close to the palace, so we just ran there to save them.” “I see. Do you know who is the owner of the palace?” “Yes, this strange man; he didn’t even notice. He was just sitting here the whole time.” Then the teacher said, “You see, you were attached to your loincloths and ran to save them, whereas he just sat here. He didn’t even run to save his palace. So who is rich here, and who is poor? All you renunciates have is a loincloth. But he doesn’t even have that much. He is really the poor man. Nothing can shake him.” King Janaka simply answered, “Well, there are people there to take care of it. This is a precious moment for me, why should I go?” Then the others realised how attached they were and got the lesson. It’s not possessions that make you rich. Even attachment to a begging bowl can make you a householder; whereas you can have a big family and still be a renunciate. It’s the attachment that makes the difference. So we should learn to empty our minds of the attachment, not of the things.'

	readingbody: 'You are ever free. Born free. Why do people feel the need to have “free time” or vacation time? Whatever you do you are doing freely if you have the right attitude. A true spiritual seeker should not discriminate between “free” days and “work” days. Learn to play even while you work. Work is worship. Work is play. Have fun always. You should never be feeling tense or that you are working so hard that you need a vacation. Let your vacation be simply a change of work. Real freedom is enjoying whatever you do. The whole of life is a drama. You are watching a continuous, constant, unending movie. In that process, if you want to go out on a day off and see a movie go through a projector, go ahead and do it. It’s a change of activity, that’s all. Whatever you do, play your part well and enjoy it.'

	readingbody: 'You are all looking for that God whose name is happiness, and your righteous approach to that happiness is what you call religion. If you approach that happiness without hurting yourself and hurting others, you are a religious person. But if you are trying to get happiness by hurting yourself or others, it’s not religious.'

	readingbody: 'Live in the golden present. Always feel, “Yes, this is my present, right now. The past is past. The future is not in our hands.” Probably someone will ask, “Then should we not plan for tomorrow?” Yes, you should plan; but you should not worry about it. Ideas come, all right, plan. But know that there is someone who is going to approve or disapprove. Leave the final decision to the higher authority and be ready for anything. If you want to plan something for tomorrow, do it for the fun of planning today. But always remember that there is a final authority. The individual proposes, God disposes. That is life.'

	readingbody: 'You are not going to get God. You are not going to surrender yourself to God. You are not even going to allow God to function through you. He is already doing that. All you have to do is know it. If you don’t know, then you think that you are doing it. So as long as you think that you are doing something, let your conscience, which is part of God, guide you. Listen within; it will direct you. It will tell you what is right and what is wrong, what to do and what not to do. It is always there to guide you. Nobody is without that. Something in us seems to unconsciously know that God is within. The guidance should come from within. That means you have to close your eyes, close your ears, close your senses to the world outside. Everyone should take at least a little time every day to sit and listen to the inner guidance. Sincerely ask: “Lord, tell me what to do. I know You are guiding me. Give me the strength and capacity to listen to You and to follow You. My contact with the outside world through the senses is not really helping me. It’s making me more and more miserable.” It’s very true. Sensual experiences will literally take you away from the inner experience. All our miseries come due to our sensual experiences. We are satisfying our senses in every way possible. Feeding the senses means the ego becomes bigger and bigger. That’s where discipline comes in. If you let loose everything, you can’t achieve anything in life. We don’t say that you should not enjoy the experience of the senses, but do so in a well-disciplined way. There should be a limitation to everything.'

	readingbody: 'The kind of realisation we talk about — that nothing outside can bring fulfillment to you — is only theoretical. You have heard of it, but mere theoretical knowledge is not enough. To experience it, you must convince your mind. Think of your past experiences outside. analyse them. Did they bring you inner experience? Did they bring you satisfaction, or were they only borrowed: they came and now they are gone? At the same time, remember what inner experience is. What do you want to experience within? A little fun? A nice taste? Inner experience does not mean, “I must just experience the taste of vanilla ice cream without eating it.” You can’t experience vanilla ice cream without eating it, but you can  experience the pleasure of eating vanilla ice cream. What is that? Satisfaction. “Ahh, I wanted vanilla ice cream, that want created an urge, we went there and got it.” So you wanted it, you got it, you ate it, and then, “Ahh, I got vanilla ice cream.” You experienced the vanilla ice cream and thus you experienced your happiness, your satisfaction. But before you wanted the ice cream you were satisfied. You were contented. The minute you thought of the ice cream you lost your contentment. You went there, got it, and got back your contentment. If you keep that contentment always, whether you get it or not, that is inner experience. The inner experience is not based on anything outside. Seek the kingdom of God, and everything else just follows. When I say everything follows that does not mean literally every thing will follow. When you get God, you won’t be filling your stomach with ice cream. But you will get the contentment of having eaten a gallon of ice cream without eating it. The contentment, not the taste.'
